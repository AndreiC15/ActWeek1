00:09:05,536 --> 00:09:07,269
Please.

182
00:09:07,271 --> 00:09:09,004
What happened? You get fired?

183
00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:10,239
- No.
- No.

184
00:09:10,241 --> 00:09:11,941
The Copa's closing for repairs,

185
00:09:11,943 --> 00:09:13,911
so he just needs something
for a couple of months.

186
00:09:22,153 --> 00:09:25,254
All the people he knows, he'll
find something in no time.

187
00:09:25,256 --> 00:09:28,524
Well, he had a great job
at the Sanitation Department.

188
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:30,493
You shouldn't have punched out
the foreman.

189
00:09:30,495 --> 00:09:32,461
He shouldn't have woke me up.

190
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:36,733
That's Tony.

191
00:09:36,735 --> 00:09:38,334
I can't believe they lost.

192
00:09:38,336 --> 00:09:40,269
- Don't worry, don't worry.
- Relax.

193
00:09:44,308 --> 00:09:46,075
That never happened before.

194
00:09:46,077 --> 00:09:48,077
They're gonna win
the World Series.

195
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,553
I'm telling you,
this is gonna be

196
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:59,522
the easiest 50 bucks
you're ever gonna make.

197
00:09:59,524 --> 00:10:00,757
Yeah, we'll see.

198
00:10:00,759 --> 00:10:03,292
Hey, there they are.

199
00:10:03,294 --> 00:10:04,994
Hi, Johnny.

200
00:10:04,996 --> 00:10:06,162
- Tony, how are you?
- Hey, Paulie.

201
00:10:06,164 --> 00:10:08,230
- How you doing?
- I'm good, I'm good.

202
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:10,065
So, uh, Johnny here
tells me you ate

203
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:12,234
48 White Castle burgers
all in one sitting.

204
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:14,069
Cheeseburgers.

205
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:15,471
You tell him, Frankie.

206
00:10:15,473 --> 00:10:16,606
I don't believe it.

207
00:10:16,608 --> 00:10:19,074
What do we care
if you believe it?

208
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:20,309
Hey, Gorman.

209
00:10:20,311 --> 00:10:22,344
What's the record here
for hot dogs?

210
00:10:22,346 --> 00:10:25,047
18, Fat Paulie.

211
00:10:25,049 --> 00:10:26,348
Why wasn't Lip in
on that contest?

212
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:27,383
What contest?

213
00:10:27,385 --> 00:10:29,084
I was hungry.

214
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:31,120
Well,
the bet's simple.

215
00:10:31,122 --> 00:10:33,489
Half a C-note.
Most hot dogs in an hour wins.

216
00:10:33,491 --> 00:10:35,126
With toppings.

217
00:10:36,628 --> 00:10:39,195
- What the hell you weigh?
- 260.

218
00:10:39,197 --> 00:10:41,230
Hey, two...
Your left ass weighs 260.

219
00:10:41,232 --> 00:10:43,800
May my mother-in-law drop dead
on the spot if I'm lying.

220
00:10:47,071 --> 00:10:49,071
- All right. You're on.
- Good.

221
00:10:51,309 --> 00:10:52,642
Pick it up, Lip!

222
00:10:52,644 --> 00:10:55,411
The baby elephant just hit 19!

223
00:10:55,413 --> 00:10:57,279
Let's go, Lip! Let's go!

224
00:10:57,281 --> 00:10:59,515
Come on, let's go, Lip!
Let's get this going!

225
00:10:59,517 --> 00:11:01,383
You're embarrassing!

226
00:11:01,385 --> 00:11:03,620
You're embarrassing your son!

227
00:11:03,622 --> 00:11:06,090
He is killing you!

228
00:11:13,364 --> 00:11:15,164
Hey, Nicky,
you doing your homework?

229
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:16,833
- Yep.
- Good.

230
00:11:18,269 --> 00:11:19,636
Where you been?

231
00:11:19,638 --> 00:11:21,470
Gorman's.

232
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:23,539
I'm making dinner.

233
00:11:25,443 --> 00:11:27,309
Fat Paulie bet me 50 bucks

234
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:29,144
he could eat
more hot dogs than me.

235
00:11:29,146 --> 00:11:30,579
He knocked off 24.

236
00:11:30,581 --> 00:11:32,314
Guy's an animal.

237
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:33,582
Are you crazy?

238
00:11:33,584 --> 00:11:35,317
You lost $50?

239
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:37,623
Dolores, please.

240
00:11:39,257 --> 00:11:40,558
I ate 26.

241
00:11:45,363 --> 00:11:48,097
You are so lucky.

242
00:11:48,099 --> 00:11:49,465
You know that?

243
00:11:49,467 --> 00:11:51,233
Rent is due on Monday.

244
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,575
You gonna get that?

245
00:12:00,244 --> 00:12:02,344
- Yeah?
- Hey, Lip.

246
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:04,380
Some guy called over here.
A doctor.

247
00:12:04,382 --> 00:12:06,215
He's looking for a driver.

248
00:12:06,217 --> 00:12:08,150
- You interested?
- Yeah.

249
00:12:08,152 --> 00:12:10,720
They're interviewing guys
tomorrow afternoon.

250
00:12:10,722 --> 00:12:15,725
The address is, uh,
881 7th Avenue.

251
00:12:15,727 --> 00:12:17,627
2:15.

252
00:12:37,381 --> 00:12:39,348
Hey. Excuse me.

253
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:41,150
We're not open right now,
but you're welcome

254
00:12:41,152 --> 00:12:43,185
to purchase tickets
to tonight's performance.

255
00:12:43,187 --> 00:12:44,353
Nah, that's all right.

256
00:12:44,355 --> 00:12:46,656
I, uh... I think
I got the wrong address,

257
00:12:46,658 --> 00:12:49,425
but, uh, is there
a doctor's office in here?

258
00:12:49,427 --> 00:12:50,760
A doctor's office?

259
00:12:50,762 --> 00:12:52,494
Dr. Shirley?

260
00:12:52,496 --> 00:12:54,229
You have the correct address.

261
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:56,434
Dr. Shirley lives upstairs,
above the Hall.

262
00:13:02,206 --> 00:13:03,675
How you doing?

263
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,454
I'm here for the driver job.

264
00:13:17,488 --> 00:13:19,256
Tony Lip.

265
00:13:20,324 --> 00:13:22,692
No Tony Lip.

266
00:13:22,694 --> 00:13:25,194
No, I should be on there.

267
00:13:25,196 --> 00:13:27,363
Uh...

268
00:13:27,365 --> 00:13:31,400
no, um, I have a Tony Val...
Valle-la-la...

269
00:13:31,402 --> 00:13:33,268
Vallelonga. Yeah.

270
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:35,605
That's me.

271
00:13:35,607 --> 00:13:37,272
Fill it out while you wait.

272
00:13:37,274 --> 00:13:38,474
What?

273
00:13:38,476 --> 00:13:40,542
Fill it out while you wait.

274
00:13:40,544 --> 00:13:42,480
Oh. Yeah.

275
00:14:04,636 --> 00:14:06,303
Have a seat.

276
00:14:34,465 --> 00:14:37,399
Mr. Vallelonga.
Sorry to keep you waiting.

277
00:14:37,401 --> 00:14:38,768
Oh.

278
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:41,871
I'm Dr. Donald Shirley.

279
00:14:41,873 --> 00:14:43,606
Tony.

280
00:14:43,608 --> 00:14:46,410
Yes. Please sit down.

281
00:14:49,047 --> 00:14:51,815
Some place you got here.

282
00:14:51,817 --> 00:14:53,850
Are them horns real?

283
00:14:53,852 --> 00:14:56,454
Elephant tusks, yes.

284
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:58,822
What about that?

285
00:14:58,824 --> 00:15:00,458
Is that a molar?

286
00:15:01,793 --> 00:15:03,292
A what?

287
00:15:03,294 --> 00:15:05,594
A molar, a-a shark tooth.

288
00:15:05,596 --> 00:15:08,064
Or a tiger's, maybe.

289
00:15:08,066 --> 00:15:10,633
It was a gift.

290
00:15:10,635 --> 00:15:13,603
I thought, uh... I thought
I was going to an office.

291
00:15:13,605 --> 00:15:16,505
They said a doctor
needed a driver.

292
00:15:16,507 --> 00:15:17,841
That's all they told you?

293
00:15:17,843 --> 00:15:19,575
Yeah.

294
00:15:19,577 --> 00:15:23,512
Actually, it's a bit more
complicated than that.

295
00:15:23,514 --> 00:15:25,717
Have you ever driven
professionally before?

296
00:15:26,752 --> 00:15:28,550
Yeah. Sanitation.

297
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:30,319
Garbage trucks.

298
00:15:30,321 --> 00:15:32,889
Plus, I drive my boss home
at night.

299
00:15:32,891 --> 00:15:34,724
But I can drive anything.

300
00:15:34,726 --> 00:15:36,793
Limos. Tow trucks.

301
00:15:36,795 --> 00:15:38,494
Snowplows. Whatever.

302
00:15:38,496 --> 00:15:39,662
I see.

303
00:15:39,664 --> 00:15:41,597
What other experience
do you have?

304
00:15:41,599 --> 00:15:43,332
I worked a lot of joints.

305
00:15:43,334 --> 00:15:45,602
Wagon Wheel,
Peppermint Lounge, Copa.

306
00:15:45,604 --> 00:15:47,402
In what capacity?

307
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:48,605
What do you mean?

308
00:15:48,607 --> 00:15:50,539
What did you do there?

309
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:52,276
Uh...

310
00:15:53,377 --> 00:15:54,944
Public relations.

311
00:15:54,946 --> 00:15:58,715
Well, first of all, Tony,
I'm not a medical doctor.

312
00:15:58,717 --> 00:15:59,916
I'm a musician.

313
00:15:59,918 --> 00:16:02,351
You mean, like, songs?

314
00:16:02,353 --> 00:16:03,585
Yes.

315
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:05,554
And I'm about to embark
on a concert tour,

316
00:16:05,556 --> 00:16:07,489
the majority of which
will be down south.

317
00:16:07,491 --> 00:16:08,725
Atlantic City.

318
00:16:08,727 --> 00:16:09,893
No.

319
00:16:09,895 --> 00:16:11,560
The Deep South.

320
00:16:11,562 --> 00:16:13,495
First, we're starting
in the Midwest,

321
00:16:13,497 --> 00:16:14,898
and then we're taking
a hard left.

322
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,900
Kentucky, North Carolina,
Tennessee,

323
00:16:16,902 --> 00:16:18,868
and on down through the Delta.

324
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:21,938
Do you foresee any issues
in working for a black man?

325
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:24,140
No.

326
00:16:24,142 --> 00:16:25,708
No, no, no.

327
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:27,777
It was just the other day,
me and the wife

328
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:29,815
had a couple of colored guys
over at the house.

329
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,850
For-for drinks.

330
00:16:33,852 --> 00:16:35,417
Hmm. I see.

331
00:16:35,419 --> 00:16:36,585
You're married.

332
00:16:36,587 --> 00:16:38,890
Yeah. Two kids.

333
00:16:40,725 --> 00:16:43,492
I'm not sure this is the
proper job for a married man.

334
00:16:43,494 --> 00:16:45,494
Why? Are we bringing broads?

335
00:16:45,496 --> 00:16:48,965
My point is we'll be gone
for eight straight weeks.

336
00:16:48,967 --> 00:16:51,634
No breaks,
right up until Christmas.

337
00:16:51,636 --> 00:16:53,970
You're quite sure you can leave
your family for that long?

338
00:16:53,972 --> 00:16:55,839
Depends what you're paying.

339
00:16:55,841 --> 00:16:57,874
A hundred dollars a week,
plus room and board.

340
00:16:57,876 --> 00:16:58,975
Hmm.

341
00:16:58,977 --> 00:17:01,510
But let me be crystal clear.

342
00:17:01,512 --> 00:17:03,478
I'm not just hiring
a chauffeur.

343
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,616
I need someone
who can handle my itinerary.

344
00:17:06,618 --> 00:17:09,451
Be a personal assistant.
I need a valet.

345
00:17:09,453 --> 00:17:12,924
I need someone who can launder
my clothes and shine my shoes.

346
00:17:14,993 --> 00:17:16,862
Good luck, Doc.

347
00:17:19,563 --> 00:17:20,866
Tony.

348
00:17:25,804 --> 00:17:27,770
I had my record label
ask around town

349
00:17:27,772 --> 00:17:29,706
to find me the right man.

350
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:32,376
Your name came up
more than once.

351
00:17:33,645 --> 00:17:36,646
You've impressed several people
with your...

352
00:17:36,648 --> 00:17:38,717
innate ability
to handle trouble.

353
00:17:39,918 --> 00:17:41,851
And that is why I called
and inquired

354
00:17:41,853 --> 00:17:43,822
about your availability.

355
00:17:46,858 --> 00:17:48,490
Okay, here's the deal.

356
00:17:48,492 --> 00:17:50,525
I got no problem
being on the road with you.

357
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:51,661
But I ain't no butler.

358
00:17:51,663 --> 00:17:53,562
I ain't ironing no shirts,

359
00:17:53,564 --> 00:17:54,931
and I'm not polishing
nobody's shoes.

360
00:17:54,933 --> 00:17:57,233
You need somebody to get you
from point A to point B?

361
00:17:57,235 --> 00:17:58,635
You need someone to make sure

362
00:17:58,637 --> 00:17:59,802
there's no problems
along the way?

363
00:17:59,804 --> 00:18:01,804
And believe me,
you and the Deep South,

364
00:18:01,806 --> 00:18:03,640
there's gonna be problems.

365
00:18:03,642 --> 00:18:04,908
So, if you want me,

366
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:06,943
it's a buck and a quarter
a week.

367
00:18:06,945 --> 00:18:09,544
Or go hire that little Chink
just pranced out of here.

368
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:11,582
See how far you get.

369
00:18:13,018 --> 00:18:16,551
Well, Mr. Vallelonga,

370
00:18:16,553 --> 00:18:18,888
thank you for stopping by.

371
00:18:31,069 --> 00:18:33,069
Hey, Bobby.

372
00:18:33,071 --> 00:18:34,971
Give me a Rheingold.

373
00:18:34,973 --> 00:18:36,841
Ice cold.

374
00:18:45,817 --> 00:18:46,851
Mr. Tony.

375
00:18:48,552 --> 00:18:50,519
Augie asking about you.

376
00:18:51,957 --> 00:18:53,690
Come on!
I'm dying of thirst over here.

377
00:18:53,692 --> 00:18:54,724
Shut up!

378
00:18:54,726 --> 00:18:56,560
I'm talking.

379
00:18:59,297 --> 00:19:00,663
When?

380
00:19:00,665 --> 00:19:02,867
Now. He in his box.

381
00:19:28,994 --> 00:19:30,494
Tony Lip.

382
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:34,030
What the hell happened
at the Copa?

383
00:19:34,032 --> 00:19:35,967
I hear you almost split
a guy's face open.

384
00:19:37,135 --> 00:19:39,869
That guy you hit,
Mikey Cerrone,

385
00:19:39,871 --> 00:19:41,873
part of
Charlie the Hand's crew.

386
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:45,043
Guess he should have
known better.

387
00:19:49,347 --> 00:19:51,647
Hand asked me to look into it.

388
00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:53,649
I spoke to Podell.

389
00:19:53,651 --> 00:19:56,855
Whole thing was, uh,
over a piece of ass, right?

390
00:19:57,989 --> 00:19:59,822
Yeah.

391
00:19:59,824 --> 00:20:03,592
Beef like that should never
happen inside the club.

392
00:20:03,594 --> 00:20:05,795
They were out of line.

393
00:20:05,797 --> 00:20:07,799
So we squashed it.

394
00:20:09,801 --> 00:20:12,769
You, uh, looking to earn
a little extra <i>scharole?</i>

395
00:20:12,771 --> 00:20:15,671
I can keep you busy
while the Copa is down.

396
00:20:15,673 --> 00:20:16,975
What do I gotta do?

397
00:20:18,943 --> 00:20:20,979
Things.

398
00:20:23,648 --> 00:20:25,214
Appreciate it, but, uh,

399
00:20:25,216 --> 00:20:27,717
I want to spend some time
with the family.

400
00:20:27,719 --> 00:20:29,619
Don't be stupid.

401
00:20:29,621 --> 00:20:32,722
You make yourself a few extra
bucks, you buy something nice

402
00:20:32,724 --> 00:20:34,991
for that pretty little wife
of yours.

403
00:20:34,993 --> 00:20:36,961
Hmm.

404
00:20:39,064 --> 00:20:40,997
Nah, I'm good.

405
00:20:40,999 --> 00:20:42,967

So, come on.
I'm dying to hear.

417
00:21:19,137 --> 00:21:20,870
What happened
with the doctor interview?

418
00:21:20,872 --> 00:21:22,872
He ain't a real doctor.

419
00:21:22,874 --> 00:21:24,273
He's a piano player.

420
00:21:24,275 --> 00:21:26,142
Well, I don't understand.

421
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:28,010
Why did they say
that he was a doctor?

422
00:21:28,012 --> 00:21:30,146
I don't know.
I think he's, like,

423
00:21:30,148 --> 00:21:32,682
a doctor of, uh,
piano playing or something.

424
00:21:32,684 --> 00:21:34,016
You can be that?

425
00:21:34,018 --> 00:21:35,685
I guess.

426
00:21:35,687 --> 00:21:37,954
He lives on top
of Carnegie Hall.

427
00:21:37,956 --> 00:21:39,822
You should've seen
this place, Dee.

428
00:21:39,824 --> 00:21:42,225
It was filled with statues
and all kinds of fancy crap.

429
00:21:42,227 --> 00:21:44,760
And he was sitting on top
of a friggin' throne

430
00:21:44,762 --> 00:21:47,196
all dressed up like, uh, like
the king of the jungle bunnies.

431
00:21:47,198 --> 00:21:50,068
He's colored?

432
00:21:52,871 --> 00:21:54,904
Well, you wouldn't last
a week with him.

433
00:21:54,906 --> 00:21:57,473
For the right money, I would.

434
00:22:07,051 --> 00:22:09,485
Yeah.

435
00:22:09,487 --> 00:22:11,087
Oh.

436
00:22:11,089 --> 00:22:13,890
Look...

437
00:22:13,892 --> 00:22:15,758
Really?

438
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,959
- Uh, okay.
- You okay?

439
00:22:16,961 --> 00:22:18,261
Okay, hang on a sec.

440
00:22:18,263 --> 00:22:22,498
It's, uh, Dr. Shirley,
the piano guy.

441
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,300
He wants to talk to you.

442
00:22:24,302 --> 00:22:25,968
- Me?
- Yeah.

443
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:27,770
What? No.

Come on.

- Take it.
- No. Tony...

446
00:22:30,308 --> 00:22:31,943
Just... just talk.

447
00:22:35,079 --> 00:22:36,814
Hello?

448
00:22:38,082 --> 00:22:40,183
Uh, good morning, Doctor.

449
00:22:40,185 --> 00:22:42,220
It's nice to talk to you.

450
00:22:47,091 --> 00:22:49,928
Well, uh, yes,
that is a long time.

451
00:22:52,864 --> 00:22:54,165
It is.

452
00:22:55,967 --> 00:22:58,067
Yes. I'm sure.

453
00:22:58,069 --> 00:23:00,002
Thank you.

454
00:23:00,004 --> 00:23:02,205
Thank you for calling.

455
00:23:02,207 --> 00:23:03,841
Bye, now.

456
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:08,079
What'd he say?

457
00:23:09,314 --> 00:23:11,347
He wanted to know
if I'd be okay

458
00:23:11,349 --> 00:23:16,219
with him taking my husband away
from his family for two months.

459
00:23:16,221 --> 00:23:19,724
He said he'd pay you
what you asked for.

460
00:23:24,796 --> 00:23:26,331
- Hey.
- Hmm?

461
00:23:28,132 --> 00:23:30,166
It's good money.

462
00:23:30,168 --> 00:23:32,036
We need it.

463
00:23:34,172 --> 00:23:38,042
Can't be eating 26 hot dogs
every day.

464
00:23:39,877 --> 00:23:42,378
I know.

465
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:45,718
I told him it was okay
for you to go.

466
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:50,219
All right, hey, look, so here's
the first half of your pay.

467
00:23:50,221 --> 00:23:52,154
You're gonna get the rest
when the tour's over.

468
00:23:52,156 --> 00:23:53,889
No, I gotta get paid
every week.

469
00:23:53,891 --> 00:23:55,891
Sorry. That's not how
the record company does it.

470
00:23:55,893 --> 00:23:58,060
We got to have some guarantee
you're gonna finish the job.

471
00:23:58,062 --> 00:24:00,963
Why wouldn't I finish the job?
I took it, didn't I?

472
00:24:00,965 --> 00:24:04,300
Well, then we got nothing
to worry about.

473
00:24:04,302 --> 00:24:06,969
Here's the deal,
Mr. Vallelonga.

474
00:24:06,971 --> 00:24:09,338
Okay, it's your job to get Don
to all his tour dates on time.

475
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:10,873
Now, if he misses any shows,

476
00:24:10,875 --> 00:24:12,074
you're not getting
your back end.

477
00:24:12,076 --> 00:24:14,277
- He's not gonna miss any show.
- Good.

478
00:24:14,279 --> 00:24:17,046
Oh, you're gonna need this.

479
00:24:17,048 --> 00:24:19,115
Now, this is the book
I was telling you about.

480
00:24:19,117 --> 00:24:21,183
Now, sometimes you guys
are staying in the same hotel,

481
00:24:21,185 --> 00:24:23,319
sometimes you're not.

482
00:24:23,321 --> 00:24:25,921
- Oh, yeah, the...
- Yeah, yeah.

483
00:24:25,923 --> 00:24:29,091
All right, don't let me down.
Let's go.

484
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:38,100
<i>Madonne,</i> is this the new one?

485
00:24:38,102 --> 00:24:40,102
Yeah, the record company
rented it.

486
00:24:40,104 --> 00:24:41,871
- It's nice, huh?
- Beautiful.

487
00:24:41,873 --> 00:24:43,472
So, what'd my sister
have to say

488
00:24:43,474 --> 00:24:45,474
about you being gone
for three weeks?

489
00:24:45,476 --> 00:24:47,877
Eight weeks.

490
00:24:47,879 --> 00:24:49,646
Ten to one,
you slap this moolie out,

491
00:24:49,648 --> 00:24:52,948
you come home in under a month.

492
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:54,651
- Come here.
- All right, boys, huddle up.

493
00:24:54,653 --> 00:24:56,952
- Say good-bye to your father.
- Frankie, Nicky. Come here.

494
00:24:56,954 --> 00:24:58,087
All right.

495
00:24:58,089 --> 00:24:59,955
- You gonna be good boys?
- Uh-huh.

496
00:24:59,957 --> 00:25:01,390
- You'll listen to your mother?
- Mm-hmm.

497
00:25:01,392 --> 00:25:03,259
Yeah? All right, give me a kiss.

498
00:25:03,261 --> 00:25:06,195
I'm counting on youse.

499
00:25:06,197 --> 00:25:08,833
- Don't go too far.
- We won't.

500
00:25:11,235 --> 00:25:14,303
- Did you go to the AAA for the maps?
- Yes.

501
00:25:14,305 --> 00:25:16,972
No. I mean, the record
companies gave me the maps

502
00:25:16,974 --> 00:25:18,976
and the itinerary,
and this thing.

503

<i>The Negro Motorist's
Green Book.</i>

504
00:25:22,347 --> 00:25:25,348
Yeah, it lists all the places
coloreds can stay down south.

505
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:28,250
Like a... you know,
traveling while black.

506
00:25:28,252 --> 00:25:31,120
- "Traveling while black"?
- Yeah, if you're black

507
00:25:31,122 --> 00:25:32,988
and you gotta travel,
for some reason.

508
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:35,991
- Got a special book for that?
- I guess.

509
00:25:35,993 --> 00:25:38,194
- Did you pack the iron?
- I ain't lugging no iron, Dee.

510
00:25:38,196 --> 00:25:40,329
- Come on.
- How are you gonna press your pants, Tony?

511
00:25:40,331 --> 00:25:42,998
I'll put 'em
under the mattress.

512
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,067
I want you
to write me a letter.

513
00:25:45,069 --> 00:25:47,136
- Every chance you get.
- I can't write letters.

514
00:25:47,138 --> 00:25:48,705
Yes, you can.

515
00:25:48,707 --> 00:25:50,272
- I can't write.
- Take you five minutes.

516
00:25:50,274 --> 00:25:51,407
- Promise me.
- It's embarrassing.

517
00:25:51,409 --> 00:25:53,209
It ain't gonna be no good.

518
00:25:53,211 --> 00:25:55,978
It's a lot cheaper than
calling long-distance, Tony.

519
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:57,980
Promise me you're gonna write.

520
00:25:57,982 --> 00:25:59,852
I promise.

521
00:26:01,552 --> 00:26:03,552
Dee, put this in a bank today.

522
00:26:03,554 --> 00:26:05,488

and most highly educated people
in the country.

682
00:36:00,719 --> 00:36:03,019
It is my feeling
that your diction,

683
00:36:03,021 --> 00:36:05,621
however charming it may be
in the tristate area,

684
00:36:05,623 --> 00:36:08,024
could use some... finessing.

685
00:36:08,026 --> 00:36:11,528
You mean diction...
like in what way?

686
00:36:12,831 --> 00:36:14,866
Like in the only way
the word is ever used.

687
00:36:16,067 --> 00:36:18,167
- Okay.
- Your intonation, inflection,

688

your choice of words.

689
00:36:19,971 --> 00:36:21,971
Hey, I got my own problems.

690
00:36:21,973 --> 00:36:23,840
Now I gotta worry
about what people think

691
00:36:23,842 --> 00:36:26,009
- about the way I talk?
- There are simple techniques

692
00:36:26,011 --> 00:36:28,644
I can teach you that are quite
effective. I can help you.

693
00:36:28,646 --> 00:36:30,179
I-I don't need no goddamn help.
People don't like

694
00:36:30,181 --> 00:36:32,617
the way I talk,
they can go take a shit.

695
00:36:33,651 --> 00:36:35,885
The profanity is another issue.

696
00:36:35,887 --> 00:36:38,087
Why are you breaking my balls?

697
00:36:38,089 --> 00:36:40,790
Because you can do better,
Mr. Vallelonga.

698
00:36:40,792 --> 00:36:43,026
Which brings me
to one more point.

699
00:36:43,028 --> 00:36:44,927
As the guest of honor,
I'll be introduced

700
00:36:44,929 --> 00:36:46,896
when entering
these intimate events.

701
00:36:46,898 --> 00:36:48,731
You will be introduced as well.

702
00:36:48,733 --> 00:36:50,833
In my humble opinion,

703
00:36:50,835 --> 00:36:53,803
"Vallelonga" may be difficult
to pronounce.

704
00:36:53,805 --> 00:36:56,039
So I was thinking...

705
00:36:56,041 --> 00:36:58,174
Valle would be more appropriate.

706
00:36:58,176 --> 00:37:00,943

707
00:37:00,945 --> 00:37:02,011

00:37:02,013 --> 00:37:03,179

709
00:37:03,181 --> 00:37:05,048
They got a problem
with Vallelonga,

710
00:37:05,050 --> 00:37:06,783
they can call me Tony Lip.

711
00:37:06,785 --> 00:37:08,684
These are genteel people.

712
00:37:08,686 --> 00:37:11,054
"Tony the Lip" may be
a little...

713
00:37:11,056 --> 00:37:13,056
worldly for them.

714
00:37:13,058 --> 00:37:15,625
Well, then it's
Tony Vallelonga.

715
00:37:15,627 --> 00:37:18,928
All these high-class people,
so much smarter than me,

716
00:37:18,930 --> 00:37:21,030
with their intelligence
and speaking abilities,

717
00:37:21,032 --> 00:37:22,965
you're telling me
they can't pronounce my name?

718
00:37:22,967 --> 00:37:25,068
They don't like it,
they can shove it up their ass.

719
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:27,072
I'll just wait outside.

720
00:37:28,106 --> 00:37:30,740
A sound compromise.

721
00:37:46,691 --> 00:37:48,791
Ladies and gentlemen,
tonight we are privileged

722
00:37:48,793 --> 00:37:52,929
to present
a great American artist.

723
00:37:52,931 --> 00:37:54,831
He gave his first
public performance

724
00:37:54,833 --> 00:37:56,032
at the age of three.

725
00:37:56,034 --> 00:37:57,733
At age 18,

726
00:37:57,735 --> 00:37:59,735
at Arthur Fiedler's invitation,

727
00:37:59,737 --> 00:38:02,105
our guest made
his concert debut

728
00:38:02,107 --> 00:38:04,073
with the Boston Pops.

729
00:38:04,075 --> 00:38:07,076
He holds doctorates
in psychology, in music

730
00:38:07,078 --> 00:38:09,679
and in the liturgical arts.

731
00:38:09,681 --> 00:38:11,814
And he has performed
at the White House twice

732
00:38:11,816 --> 00:38:13,449
in the past 14 months.

733
00:38:13,451 --> 00:38:16,085
He is a true virtuoso.

734
00:38:16,087 --> 00:38:17,887
- And it's a...
- "Virtuoso."

735
00:38:17,889 --> 00:38:20,823
- It's a special treat for me...
- That's Italian.

736
00:38:20,825 --> 00:38:24,227
Means, uh, means really good.

737
00:38:24,229 --> 00:38:26,896
So, ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome

738
00:38:26,898 --> 00:38:29,067
the Don Shirley Trio.

739
00:40:02,393 --> 00:40:04,193
A new pair of shoes!

740
00:40:05,997 --> 00:40:08,297
- Hard ten! Lady's friend.
- He keeps on winning!

741
00:40:08,299 --> 00:40:11,033
It's your dice.
I'm just having a lucky night.

742
00:40:11,035 --> 00:40:12,268
You cheating, brother!

743
00:40:12,270 --> 00:40:15,037
- Tony.
- Get him again. Get him again.

744
00:40:15,039 --> 00:40:17,106
- Boss man's calling.
- He ain't my boss.

745
00:40:17,108 --> 00:40:18,908
I work for the record company.

746
00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:20,876
Yeah, I work
for the record company, too.

747
00:40:20,878 --> 00:40:22,278
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, come on, man.

748
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:24,347
Hey, give us a chance
to win back our loot, huh?

749
00:40:24,349 --> 00:40:26,015
I'm sorry, fellas, duty calls.

750
00:40:26,017 --> 00:40:28,117
- Come on, man.
- "Duty calls"?

751
00:40:28,119 --> 00:40:30,353
My man, my duty is
to get my money back.

752
00:40:30,355 --> 00:40:32,355
I've been looking for you.

753
00:40:32,357 --> 00:40:35,424
Yeah, sorry. The guys
were having a little game.

754
00:40:35,426 --> 00:40:38,894
Next time you need
extra money, just ask me.

755
00:40:38,896 --> 00:40:40,396
It's more fun winning it.

756
00:40:40,398 --> 00:40:42,198
And what if you lost?

757
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:45,167
Grab some cards.
I don't lose, Doc.

758
00:40:45,169 --> 00:40:47,169
I don't lose.

759
00:40:47,171 --> 00:40:48,971
So stooping down in the gravel

760
00:40:48,973 --> 00:40:51,140
pitching dice for pocket change
makes you a winner?

761
00:40:51,142 --> 00:40:53,042
What are you
giving me shit for?

762
00:40:53,044 --> 00:40:54,910
Everybody was doing it.

763
00:40:54,912 --> 00:40:58,381
They didn't have a choice
whether to be inside or out.

764
00:40:58,383 --> 00:41:00,251
You did.

765
00:41:03,354 --> 00:41:06,057
Now, wipe off your knees.
You have dirt on them.

766
00:41:26,277 --> 00:41:29,111

767
00:41:29,113 --> 00:41:31,280

Hamburgers, mostly.

769
00:41:34,185 --> 00:41:37,953
"So don't worry about me
not eating good.

770
00:41:37,955 --> 00:41:41,324
"I saw Dr. Shirley

771

00:41:43,461 --> 00:41:46,996

779

Who?

782
00:42:15,159 --> 00:42:17,694
On the radio.

783
00:42:17,696 --> 00:42:19,995
Little Richard.

784
00:42:19,997 --> 00:42:22,064
Really?
That's Little Richard?

785
00:42:22,066 --> 00:42:23,532
Yeah.

786
00:42:23,534 --> 00:42:25,201
Think you could play
something like that, Doc?

♪ Lucille...

Got that right.

790
00:42:32,944 --> 00:42:35,444
So, where did this "Tony
the Lip" moniker come from?

791
00:42:35,446 --> 00:42:38,447
It's not Tony the Lip.

792
00:42:38,449 --> 00:42:41,117
It's Tony Lip. One word.

793
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:43,452
I got it when I was kid,
'cause my friend said

794
00:42:43,454 --> 00:42:46,255
I was the best bullshit artist
in the Bronx.

795
00:42:46,257 --> 00:42:48,290
Why are you smiling?

796
00:42:48,292 --> 00:42:50,092
What do you mean?

797
00:42:50,094 --> 00:42:52,228
It doesn't bother you
that your friends,

798
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:54,563
the people closest to you,
consider you a liar?

799
00:42:54,565 --> 00:42:56,198
Who said "liar"?

800
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:58,334
I said "bullshit artist."

801
00:42:58,336 --> 00:43:00,069
And what's the difference?

802
00:43:00,071 --> 00:43:02,338
'Cause I don't lie. Ever.

803
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:04,507
I'm just good
at talking people into...

you know, doing things
they don't want to do.

805
00:43:07,011 --> 00:43:09,178

806
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:11,180
And you're proud of that?

807
00:43:11,182 --> 00:43:12,515

You never heard
of Chubby Checker?

812
00:43:21,225 --> 00:43:23,058
Of course I've heard of him.

- I mean...

But I like this.
This is nice.

815

He's got a silky voice,
very smooth.

Yeah, he's terrific.

830
00:44:39,203 --> 00:44:41,237
Grabbed the rock

Thank you, Oleg.

832
00:44:42,608 --> 00:44:44,173
Nice turtleneck.

833
00:44:44,175 --> 00:44:45,543
Way to mix it up.

834
00:44:48,412 --> 00:44:50,412
Got you an apple, Doc.

What'd I do?

839
00:45:05,263 --> 00:45:07,496
You stole a jade stone
from the store.

840
00:45:07,498 --> 00:45:09,633
- No, I didn't.
- He watched you do it.

841
00:45:09,635 --> 00:45:11,534
I didn't steal no stone.

842
00:45:11,536 --> 00:45:13,469
You picked it up
and put it in your pocket.

843
00:45:13,471 --> 00:45:15,304
I picked up a rock
off of the ground.

844
00:45:15,306 --> 00:45:16,372
I didn't steal from a box.

845
00:45:16,374 --> 00:45:18,507
Now, why would you pick up
a rock off the ground?

846
00:45:18,509 --> 00:45:20,376
I don't know.

847
00:45:20,378 --> 00:45:22,378
'Cause it ain't stealing.

848
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:23,579
It's just a regular rock.

849
00:45:23,581 --> 00:45:25,548
And why would you want
a regular rock?

850
00:45:25,550 --> 00:45:27,182
To have.

851
00:45:27,184 --> 00:45:28,885
For luck, maybe.

852
00:45:28,887 --> 00:45:30,185
A lucky rock.

853
00:45:30,187 --> 00:45:32,189
- Yeah.
- Let me see it.

854
00:45:43,534 --> 00:45:45,902
Mm-mm.

855
00:45:45,904 --> 00:45:48,337
Take it back and pay for it.

856
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:52,341
I told you that kraut
was a snake.

857
00:45:52,343 --> 00:45:54,510
Rats me out for something
I didn't even do!

858
00:45:54,512 --> 00:45:56,613
Pay for the stone, Tony;
you'll feel better.

859
00:45:56,615 --> 00:45:59,716
I feel fine. And I ain't paying
for no regular rock

860
00:45:59,718 --> 00:46:02,284
I found in the dirt.

861
00:46:02,286 --> 00:46:05,487
Do not drive, Mr. Vallelonga.

862
00:46:07,659 --> 00:46:09,661
Put it back.

863
00:46:33,619 --> 00:46:36,218
- Feel better?
- No.

864
00:46:36,220 --> 00:46:38,955
If you'd like, Tony,
I'd happily buy you the stone.

865
00:46:38,957 --> 00:46:42,391
Don't bother.
You took all the fun out of it.

866
00:47:18,997 --> 00:47:21,563
Excuse me. Sir.

867
00:47:21,565 --> 00:47:23,365
I'm with the band.

868
00:47:23,367 --> 00:47:24,500
You're all set up.

869
00:47:24,502 --> 00:47:26,703
This isn't the piano, right?

870
00:47:26,705 --> 00:47:28,004
That's it.

871
00:47:28,006 --> 00:47:29,706
It ain't a Steinway.

872
00:47:29,708 --> 00:47:31,440
So what?

873
00:47:31,442 --> 00:47:34,276
Dr. Shirley only plays
on Steinway grand pianos.

874
00:47:34,278 --> 00:47:36,311
It's in his written contract.

875
00:47:36,313 --> 00:47:37,579
Who's Dr. Shirley?

876
00:47:37,581 --> 00:47:39,849
Dr. Shirley.
The Don Shirley Trio.

877
00:47:39,851 --> 00:47:41,718
They're playing tonight.

878
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:43,452
Does it really matter?

879
00:47:43,454 --> 00:47:46,290
Yeah, it does.
It's in his contract.

880
00:47:47,591 --> 00:47:49,458
Come on, man.
Man, these coons

881
00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:51,529
can play on anything
you put in front of them.

882
00:47:55,667 --> 00:47:57,466
But it's a piece of shit.

883
00:47:57,468 --> 00:47:59,468
And there's garbage in there.

884
00:47:59,470 --> 00:48:01,370
So take it out.

885
00:48:01,372 --> 00:48:02,607
What'd you say?

886
00:48:03,709 --> 00:48:05,309
You heard me.

887
00:48:08,412 --> 00:48:10,512
Hey. You got two, three hours.

888
00:48:10,514 --> 00:48:12,548
Just get
a clean Steinway in here.

889
00:48:12,550 --> 00:48:14,617
Oh, there ain't a Steinway
on campus.

890
00:48:14,619 --> 00:48:16,418
Not my problem.

891
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:17,821
I bet
there's not two Steinways

892
00:48:17,823 --> 00:48:19,488
in the whole state of Indiana.

893
00:48:19,490 --> 00:48:21,725
I guess you'd better move
your ass, then.

894
00:48:21,727 --> 00:48:23,762
Who you think you're
talking to, greaseball?

895
00:48:53,725 --> 00:48:55,457
<i>Dear Dolores:</i>

896
00:48:55,459 --> 00:48:57,526
<i>This morning
I had steak and eggs</i>

897
00:48:57,528 --> 00:48:58,795
<i>for breakfast.</i>

898
00:48:58,797 --> 00:49:02,799
<i>The band has been playing
at very ritzy joints.</i>

899
00:49:02,801 --> 00:49:05,101
<i>Dr. Shirley and I
are getting along pretty good.</i>

900
00:49:05,103 --> 00:49:07,837
<i>But sometimes
I think he gets sad,</i>

901
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:10,405
<i>and that's why
he drinks too much.</i>

902
00:49:10,407 --> 00:49:13,810
<i>I never knew how very beautiful
this country was.</i>

903
00:49:13,812 --> 00:49:16,345
<i>Now that I'm seeing it, I know.</i>

904
00:49:16,347 --> 00:49:18,514
<i>You won't believe
how beautiful nature is.</i>

905
00:49:18,516 --> 00:49:20,817
<i>It is as beautiful as they say.</i>

906
00:49:20,819 --> 00:49:23,686
<i>And the traffic out here
in the country is nothing,</i>

907
00:49:23,688 --> 00:49:25,587
<i>which is fine by me.</i>

908
00:49:25,589 --> 00:49:28,625
<i>Right now I'm eating spaghetti
and meatballs in a diner</i>

909
00:49:28,627 --> 00:49:32,361
<i>that tastes like ketchup
on Chinese noodles.</i>

910
00:49:32,363 --> 00:49:33,595
<i>We are heading down south now.</i>

911
00:49:33,597 --> 00:49:36,900
<i>I will write you another letter
when we get down south.</i>

912
00:49:36,902 --> 00:49:39,636
<i>I love you. Your husband, Tony.</i>

913
00:49:39,638 --> 00:49:41,671
<i>P.S. Kiss the kids for me.</i>

914
00:49:50,581 --> 00:49:52,148
Got any family, Doc?

915
00:49:52,150 --> 00:49:53,683
Not really.

916
00:49:53,685 --> 00:49:56,453
Not really?
Either you do or you don't.

917
00:49:57,756 --> 00:49:59,823
It's a long story, Tony.

918
00:49:59,825 --> 00:50:02,992
What, we're in a hurry now?

919
00:50:02,994 --> 00:50:05,462
Let's hear it.

920
00:50:06,497 --> 00:50:08,597
I have a brother somewhere.

921
00:50:08,599 --> 00:50:11,567
We used to get together
once in a while,

922
00:50:11,569 --> 00:50:13,837
but it got more and more
difficult to stay in touch.

923
00:50:13,839 --> 00:50:17,173
Curse of being
a musician, I guess.

924
00:50:17,175 --> 00:50:19,609
Always on the road.

925
00:50:19,611 --> 00:50:21,711
Like a carnival worker.

926
00:50:21,713 --> 00:50:24,747
- Hmm.
- Or a criminal.

927
00:50:24,749 --> 00:50:27,416
Took quite the toll
on my marriage as well.

928
00:50:27,418 --> 00:50:29,018
- You're married?
- Was.

929
00:50:29,020 --> 00:50:30,954
June.

930
00:50:30,956 --> 00:50:32,789
Good person.

931
00:50:32,791 --> 00:50:34,991
Terrible grammar,
but a kind soul.

932
00:50:34,993 --> 00:50:36,893
You'd quite like her.

933
00:50:36,895 --> 00:50:38,493
June.

934
00:50:38,495 --> 00:50:40,632
Like, uh, like Lassie's mom.

935
00:50:42,499 --> 00:50:45,001
Unfortunately,
I couldn't do a husband act

936
00:50:45,003 --> 00:50:47,502
and a concert pianist act.

937
00:50:47,504 --> 00:50:50,507
Couldn't seem to manage
both worlds.

938
00:50:52,644 --> 00:50:54,811
Kentucky Fried Chicken.

939
00:50:54,813 --> 00:50:56,511
In Kentucky!

940
00:50:56,513 --> 00:50:58,617
When's that ever gonna happen?

941
00:51:09,593 --> 00:51:11,928
All right!

942
00:51:11,930 --> 00:51:13,630
Hey, you want some?

943
00:51:13,632 --> 00:51:15,632
I'm fine. Thank you, Tony.

944
00:51:15,634 --> 00:51:17,499
All right.

945
00:51:17,501 --> 00:51:21,804
Mmm. I think this is
the best Kentucky Fried Chicken

946
00:51:21,806 --> 00:51:23,740
I ever had.

947
00:51:23,742 --> 00:51:25,775
Probably 'cause it's fresher
down here, right?

948
00:51:25,777 --> 00:51:28,543
I don't think I've ever met
anyone with your appetite.

949
00:51:28,545 --> 00:51:30,914
No. I got the bucket
so you could have some.

950
00:51:30,916 --> 00:51:33,783
I've never had fried chicken
in my life.

951
00:51:33,785 --> 00:51:35,752
Who you bullshitting?

952
00:51:35,754 --> 00:51:37,654
You people love
the fried chicken,

953
00:51:37,656 --> 00:51:39,756
the grits
and the collard greens.

954
00:51:39,758 --> 00:51:42,557
I love it, too.
Negro cooks used to make it

955
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:44,694
all the time
when I was in the Army.

956
00:51:44,696 --> 00:51:47,096
You have a very narrow
assessment of me, Tony.

957
00:51:47,098 --> 00:51:49,732
Yeah, right? I'm good.

958
00:51:49,734 --> 00:51:52,035
No. No, you're not good.
You're bad.

959
00:51:52,037 --> 00:51:54,070
I'm saying, just because
other Negroes enjoy

960
00:51:54,072 --> 00:51:56,739
certain types of music,
it doesn't mean I have to.

961
00:51:56,741 --> 00:51:59,574
- Nor do we all eat the same kind of food.
- Whoa.

962
00:51:59,576 --> 00:52:00,910
Wait a minute.

963
00:52:00,912 --> 00:52:02,912
If you said
all guineas like pizza

964
00:52:02,914 --> 00:52:05,114
and spaghetti and meatballs,
I'm not gonna get insulted.

965
00:52:05,116 --> 00:52:06,849
You're missing the point.

966
00:52:06,851 --> 00:52:08,985
For you to make the assumption
that every Negro...

967
00:52:08,987 --> 00:52:11,087
- Hey, you want some or not?
- No.

968
00:52:11,089 --> 00:52:12,855
Here. Come on.

969
00:52:12,857 --> 00:52:14,657
- Tell me that don't smell good.
- It...

970
00:52:14,659 --> 00:52:16,558
- Huh?
- It smells okay.

971
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:19,729
I prefer not to get grease
on my blanket.

972
00:52:19,731 --> 00:52:21,864
Ooh, I'm gonna get
grease on my blankey.

973
00:52:21,866 --> 00:52:23,900
Come on, have a piece.
It ain't gonna kill you.

974
00:52:23,902 --> 00:52:25,735
- Come on, take it, eat it.
- No.

975
00:52:25,737 --> 00:52:27,870
Take it.
I'm throwing it in the back.

976
00:52:27,872 --> 00:52:30,006
- You... Don't you dare.
- Then you better take it.

977
00:52:30,008 --> 00:52:32,742
How? Do you have plates
or utensils?

978
00:52:32,744 --> 00:52:34,110
Eat it with your hands!

979
00:52:34,112 --> 00:52:35,878
- That's how you're supposed to.
- I can't do that.

980
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:37,613
Eat it. Come on.
Take it, take it, take it.

981
00:52:37,615 --> 00:52:39,015
I gotta drive.
Ten and two on the wheel.

982
00:52:39,017 --> 00:52:40,683
- Come on. Take it, take it, take it.
- Tony...

983
00:52:40,685 --> 00:52:41,884
Come on, come on.

984
00:52:41,886 --> 00:52:43,886
There you go.

985
00:52:43,888 --> 00:52:45,755
Huh?

986
00:52:45,757 --> 00:52:47,623
I-I can't do this, Tony.

987
00:52:47,625 --> 00:52:49,792
Eat the goddamn thing!

988
00:52:49,794 --> 00:52:51,763
Jesus.

989
00:53:01,773 --> 00:53:04,173
- What, no good?
- Mm.

990
00:53:08,780 --> 00:53:11,748
It just seems...

991
00:53:11,750 --> 00:53:14,050
so un... unsanitary.

992
00:53:14,052 --> 00:53:15,918
Who gives a shit?

993
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:18,054
Just relax and enjoy it.

994
00:53:18,056 --> 00:53:21,090
You know,
my father used to say...

995
00:53:21,092 --> 00:53:23,826
"Whatever you do,
do it a hundred percent."

996
00:53:23,828 --> 00:53:26,763
When you work, work.
When you laugh, laugh.

997
00:53:26,765 --> 00:53:29,999
When you eat,
eat like it's your last meal.

998
00:53:30,001 --> 00:53:31,801
You want another piece?

999
00:53:31,803 --> 00:53:33,636
Here. Have a breast.

1000
00:53:33,638 --> 00:53:34,873
Delicious.

1001
00:53:36,041 --> 00:53:37,840
Take it. Here you go.

1002
00:53:37,842 --> 00:53:40,076
What do we do about the bones?

1003
00:53:42,147 --> 00:53:44,082
We do this.

1004
00:53:45,917 --> 00:53:47,216

I beg your pardon?

Come on, brother,

Oh, I-I'd rather not.

No, no,
let him alone, let him alone.

00:55:52,210 --> 00:55:55,077
He just afraid of getting that
butler uniform a little dusty.

1038
00:55:55,079 --> 00:55:56,812
Mm.

1039
00:55:56,814 --> 00:55:59,148
I'm just, um...

"Delightful dinners

1049
00:57:03,181 --> 00:57:05,881
- Yeah?
- Get up. It's George.

1050
00:57:05,883 --> 00:57:07,883
Get up.

1051
00:57:07,885 --> 00:57:10,088
Tony, come on. Hurry up.

1052
00:57:11,589 --> 00:57:13,889
Dr. Shirley's in trouble.

1053
00:57:13,891 --> 00:57:16,025
I went out for a drink,
I walk into this bar,

1054
00:57:16,027 --> 00:57:17,893
and Dr. Shirley's in there
getting bounced around.

1055
00:57:17,895 --> 00:57:20,296
I didn't want to leave him,
but I didn't know what to do.

1056
00:57:20,298 --> 00:57:21,931
Who let him out of his cage?

1057
00:57:21,933 --> 00:57:23,899
And they put that little tie
on him, too.

1058
00:57:23,901 --> 00:57:25,101
- Why you all dressed up?
- Yeah.

1059
00:57:27,138 --> 00:57:29,040
Get your hands off him.

1060
00:57:31,142 --> 00:57:34,310
What in the good goddamn
we got here, fellas?

1061
00:57:34,312 --> 00:57:35,845
Hand him over.

1062
00:57:35,847 --> 00:57:37,980
We walk out.
Won't be a problem.

1063
00:57:37,982 --> 00:57:40,116
I just wanted a drink, Tony.

1064
00:57:40,118 --> 00:57:42,184
Hey, I told you we'll leave.

1065
00:57:42,186 --> 00:57:45,054
- Not a big deal. Come on.
- He ain't going nowhere.

1066
00:57:45,056 --> 00:57:47,089
We need a Brillo Pad
to wash these dishes with.

1067
00:57:47,091 --> 00:57:48,958
Listen, assholes.

1068
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:51,327
Do yourselves a favor
and let him go.

1069
00:57:51,329 --> 00:57:52,797
Now!

1070
00:57:54,932 --> 00:57:56,868
Say it nice.

1071
00:57:57,935 --> 00:58:00,002
I just said it nice.

1072
00:58:00,004 --> 00:58:03,272
This boy is gonna get
what he's got coming to him.

1073
00:58:05,076 --> 00:58:09,013
And you, you ain't got no say.

1074
00:58:11,082 --> 00:58:12,448
Maybe.

1075
00:58:12,450 --> 00:58:15,951
But whatever happens here,
I'm gonna put a bullet

1076
00:58:15,953 --> 00:58:18,087
right in the middle
of your thick skull.

1077
00:58:18,089 --> 00:58:21,190
He ain't got no gun, Ray.

1078
00:58:21,192 --> 00:58:23,359
He's full of shit.

1079
00:58:23,361 --> 00:58:25,930
What if he ain't?

1080
00:58:29,100 --> 00:58:31,467
Well, I sure ain't.

1081
00:58:31,469 --> 00:58:35,306
And I ain't about to let this
come to pass in my place.

1082
00:58:38,142 --> 00:58:39,975
Let the spook go.

1083
00:58:39,977 --> 00:58:41,012
Let him go.

1084
00:58:42,113 --> 00:58:44,080
Come on.

1085
00:58:44,082 --> 00:58:46,115
Get him out of here.

1086
00:58:46,117 --> 00:58:49,919
I want these Yankees
off of my property.

1087
00:58:49,921 --> 00:58:52,321
- Go on.
- Go on, George. Go. Go.

1088
00:58:52,323 --> 00:58:54,325
I got you, Doc.

1089
00:58:56,361 --> 00:58:57,428
Go on.

1090
00:59:04,535 --> 00:59:06,936
- You out of your mind?
- I'm sorry.

1091
00:59:06,938 --> 00:59:09,939
I didn't mean to put you
in that position.

1092
00:59:09,941 --> 00:59:11,307
Wait, wait, wait.

1093
00:59:11,309 --> 00:59:14,312
Are you gonna throw up again?

1094
00:59:16,013 --> 00:59:17,446
I'm okay.

1095
00:59:17,448 --> 00:59:19,348
Honest to God, Doc,
I don't understand you.

1096
00:59:19,350 --> 00:59:22,017
You could have drunk here.
You got a whole bottle.

1097
00:59:22,019 --> 00:59:24,120
I just needed some air.

1098
00:59:24,122 --> 00:59:25,154
Air?

1099
00:59:25,156 --> 00:59:27,058
Do you know where you are?

1100
00:59:28,159 --> 00:59:30,292
Does geography really matter?

1101
00:59:30,294 --> 00:59:32,294
What?

1102
00:59:32,296 --> 00:59:35,965
If I was in a bar
in your neighborhood,

1103
00:59:35,967 --> 00:59:39,370
would the conversation
be any different?

1104
00:59:42,006 --> 00:59:44,440
From now on, you don't go
nowhere without me.

1105
00:59:44,442 --> 00:59:47,076
Nowhere!

1106
00:59:47,078 --> 00:59:49,480
- Got it?
- I-I understand.

1107
00:59:50,515 --> 00:59:52,181
Where's your room?

1108
00:59:52,183 --> 00:59:54,116
Tony.

1109
00:59:54,118 --> 00:59:56,051
What?

1110
00:59:56,053 --> 00:59:58,755
Do you really have a gun?

1111
00:59:58,757 --> 01:00:01,190
Course not.

1112
01:00:01,192 --> 01:00:03,896
Doc, where's your goddamn room?

1113
01:00:07,766 --> 01:00:09,265
- Come on.
- There it is.

1114
01:00:09,267 --> 01:00:10,533
Over there?

1115
01:00:10,535 --> 01:00:12,134
You gotta get to bed, Doc.

1116
01:00:12,136 --> 01:00:15,004
You got a big show
tomorrow night. Come on.

1117
01:00:34,225 --> 01:00:36,091
Thank you.

1118
01:00:36,093 --> 01:00:37,560
Louisville.

1119
01:00:37,562 --> 01:00:40,095
Thank you for
your warm hospitality.

1120
01:00:40,097 --> 01:00:42,031
Bravo!

1121
01:00:45,236 --> 01:00:48,005
Thank you. Thank you.

1122
01:00:51,075 --> 01:00:54,109
♪ Why oh why

1123
01:00:54,111 --> 01:00:55,478
♪ Has my baby...

1124
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:57,513
Don't be lazy, Tony. Enunciate.

1125
01:00:57,515 --> 01:00:59,515
- I am.
- Betty bought a bit of better butter

1126
01:00:59,517 --> 01:01:01,417
- to make the bitter butter better.
- Betty bought...

1127
01:01:01,419 --> 01:01:05,221
B-Bought... Betty bought
butta-er, butta...

1128
01:01:05,223 --> 01:01:07,590
Who says that? Butta-er.

1129
01:01:07,592 --> 01:01:09,158
You have to start
somewhere, Tony.

1130
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:10,459
A singer does vocal exercises.

1131
01:01:10,461 --> 01:01:12,495
An athlete warms up
before they rehearse.

1132
01:01:12,497 --> 01:01:14,363
Athletes practice.
They don't rehearse.

1133
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:18,604
Ah, shit.

1134
01:02:42,688 --> 01:02:46,623
Ladies and gentlemen,
a very special guest

1135
01:02:46,625 --> 01:02:48,625
from the far north,

1136
01:02:48,627 --> 01:02:51,095
Don Shirley.

1137
01:02:54,565 --> 01:02:58,200
Accompanying Mr. Shirley,
the members of his trio,

1138
01:02:58,202 --> 01:03:02,739
Oleg Malacovich, George Dyer,
and his associate

1139
01:03:02,741 --> 01:03:06,743
Tony Valle... Valle...
Vallelong-longia.

1140
01:03:11,783 --> 01:03:14,450
Oh, this is my lovely wife,
Margaret.

1141
01:03:14,452 --> 01:03:15,619
If you gentlemen don't mind,

1142
01:03:15,621 --> 01:03:16,953
we're going to steal
Donnie away

1143
01:03:16,955 --> 01:03:18,690
for some, uh, introductions.

1144
01:03:21,192 --> 01:03:23,492
I'd like you all
to meet Don Shirley.

1145
01:03:23,494 --> 01:03:25,662
- Yeah. I'll take one.
- Hmm.

1146
01:03:25,664 --> 01:03:27,196
What's that?

1147
01:03:27,198 --> 01:03:28,698
A pimento and cheese
sandwich, sir.

1148
01:03:28,700 --> 01:03:30,501
Yeah, I'll try one of them.

1149
01:03:33,270 --> 01:03:35,272
Oof.

1150
01:03:40,812 --> 01:03:42,446
Sorry. Not for me.

1151
01:03:51,255 --> 01:03:53,222
Earlier this week,
we asked our help

1152
01:03:53,224 --> 01:03:55,424
what Mr. Shirley
might like for supper.

1153
01:03:55,426 --> 01:03:58,460
So the boys in the kitchen
whipped up a special menu

1154
01:03:58,462 --> 01:03:59,629
- in honor of our guest.
- Oh!

1155
01:03:59,631 --> 01:04:01,698
Gentlemen.

1156
01:04:01,700 --> 01:04:03,600
Home-cooked fried chicken.

1157
01:04:10,609 --> 01:04:12,274
There we go.

1158
01:04:12,276 --> 01:04:14,309
Bring it in. Serve it up hot.

1159
01:04:43,742 --> 01:04:47,211
Thank you. Thank you.

1160
01:04:48,479 --> 01:04:50,446
We'll return after
a brief intermission.

1161
01:04:53,284 --> 01:04:55,350
Excuse me, Don.

1162
01:04:55,352 --> 01:04:57,721
- Lovely work in there.
- Why, thank you.

1163
01:04:57,723 --> 01:04:59,555
Uh, are you looking
for the commode?

1164
01:04:59,557 --> 01:05:01,624
- Yes. I...
- Yeah, here. Let me help you.

1165
01:05:01,626 --> 01:05:03,561
It's right out there
before that pine.

1166
01:05:08,633 --> 01:05:10,633
I'd prefer not to use that.

1167
01:05:10,635 --> 01:05:11,868
Well, don't be silly, Don.

1168
01:05:11,870 --> 01:05:13,903
It looks a lot worse
from the outside.

1169
01:05:13,905 --> 01:05:16,472
And I suppose you'd know
from experience.

1170
01:05:16,474 --> 01:05:19,243
Well, I've never had
any complaints.

1171
01:05:22,814 --> 01:05:24,681
Well, I could return
to my motel

1172
01:05:24,683 --> 01:05:26,916
and use the facilities there,

1173
01:05:26,918 --> 01:05:30,254
but that would take
at least a half an hour.

1174
01:05:33,658 --> 01:05:35,660
We don't mind waiting.

1175
01:05:36,895 --> 01:05:38,795
<i>Why don't I just pull over?</i>

1176
01:05:38,797 --> 01:05:40,362
You can piss in the woods.

1177
01:05:40,364 --> 01:05:41,530
Animals go in the woods.

1178
01:05:41,532 --> 01:05:42,832
It's gonna be
at least 20 minutes,

1179
01:05:42,834 --> 01:05:44,934
I gotta go all the way back
to your motel.

1180
01:05:44,936 --> 01:05:46,435
So let's just get there

1181
01:05:46,437 --> 01:05:48,370
so I can go back
and finish the show.

1182
01:05:48,372 --> 01:05:50,807
See, that's the
difference between you and me.

1183
01:05:50,809 --> 01:05:52,508
I'd have zero problem
going in the woods.

1184
01:05:52,510 --> 01:05:53,743
I'm well aware.

1185
01:05:53,745 --> 01:05:55,678
What are you sore at me for?

1186
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:57,579
I don't make the rules
down here.

1187
01:05:57,581 --> 01:05:58,948
No?

1188
01:05:58,950 --> 01:06:00,817
Then who does?

1189
01:06:00,819 --> 01:06:02,652
Oh.

1190
01:06:02,654 --> 01:06:05,487
You're saying just 'cause
I'm white and they're white?

1191
01:06:05,489 --> 01:06:06,923
You know, that's a very
prejudiced thing

1192
01:06:06,925 --> 01:06:08,557
you just said there.

1193
01:06:08,559 --> 01:06:09,692
A very prejudiced thing.

1194
01:06:09,694 --> 01:06:11,795
I got more in common
with the Hymies

1195
01:06:11,797 --> 01:06:13,595
at 2nd Avenue Deli than I do

1196
01:06:13,597 --> 01:06:15,131
with these hillbilly pricks
down here.

1197
01:06:15,133 --> 01:06:16,532
Eyes on the road.

1198
01:06:16,534 --> 01:06:17,366
You always say that

1199
01:06:17,368 --> 01:06:18,902
when you don't like
what I'm saying.

1200
01:06:18,904 --> 01:06:20,705
Eyes on the road.

1201
01:06:24,542 --> 01:06:26,475
I don't get it.

1202
01:06:26,477 --> 01:06:29,578
How does he smile and shake
their hands like that?

1203
01:06:29,580 --> 01:06:31,815
They try to pull
that outhouse shit on me,

1204
01:06:31,817 --> 01:06:33,852
I'd piss right
on the living room floor.

1205
01:06:35,654 --> 01:06:37,588
Don't-don't do that.

1206
01:06:38,957 --> 01:06:41,760
We have many
concert dates left.

1207
01:06:43,895 --> 01:06:46,428
Yeah? So?

1208
01:06:46,430 --> 01:06:49,333
You realize we're contractually
obliged to perform them?

1209
01:06:50,501 --> 01:06:51,835
Course I do.

1210
01:06:51,837 --> 01:06:54,469
You don't play,
we don't get paid.

1211
01:06:54,471 --> 01:06:55,872
What's your point?

1212
01:06:55,874 --> 01:06:58,975
Ugly circumstances
are going to happen again,

1213
01:06:58,977 --> 01:07:01,443
so control yourself.

1214
01:07:01,445 --> 01:07:03,849
Don't lecture me, you rat.

1215
01:07:05,750 --> 01:07:08,017
Dr. Shirley could have
stayed up north,

1216
01:07:08,019 --> 01:07:10,720
getting rear end kissed
at Park Avenue parties

1217
01:07:10,722 --> 01:07:12,622
for three times money.

1218
01:07:12,624 --> 01:07:14,924
But he ask for this.

1219
01:07:19,496 --> 01:07:20,699
Why?

1220
01:07:40,517 --> 01:07:42,785
What on God's green Earth
are you doing?

1221
01:07:42,787 --> 01:07:44,687
A letter.

1222
01:07:44,689 --> 01:07:47,924
Looks more like
a piecemeal ransom note.

1223
01:07:47,926 --> 01:07:49,794
May I?

1224
01:07:56,668 --> 01:07:58,801
"Dear Dolores."

1225
01:07:58,803 --> 01:08:00,236
D-E-A-R.

1226
01:08:00,238 --> 01:08:01,838
This is an animal.

1227
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:04,539
"I'm meeting all
the highly leading citizens

1228
01:08:04,541 --> 01:08:06,809
"of the town.

1229
01:08:06,811 --> 01:08:10,545
"People that use big words,
all of them.

1230
01:08:10,547 --> 01:08:13,082
"But you know me. I get by.

1231
01:08:13,084 --> 01:08:14,951
I'm a good bullshitter."

1232
01:08:14,953 --> 01:08:17,720
Two T's in "bullshitter."

1233
01:08:17,722 --> 01:08:21,858
"As I'm writing this letter,
I'm eating potato chips,

1234
01:08:21,860 --> 01:08:25,594
"and I'm starting
to get thirsty.

1235
01:08:25,596 --> 01:08:29,098
"I washed my socks
and dried them on the TV.

1236
01:08:29,100 --> 01:08:31,868
I should have brung the iron."

1237
01:08:31,870 --> 01:08:33,705
You know this is pathetic,
right?

1238
01:08:34,839 --> 01:08:36,839
Tell me what you're trying
to say.

1239
01:08:36,841 --> 01:08:39,108
I don't know.

1240
01:08:39,110 --> 01:08:41,543
You know, I miss her and shit.

1241
01:08:41,545 --> 01:08:42,712
Then say that.

1242
01:08:42,714 --> 01:08:44,747
But do it in a manner
that no one else

1243
01:08:44,749 --> 01:08:46,548
has ever done it before.

1244
01:08:46,550 --> 01:08:47,986
And without the profanity.

1245
01:08:48,987 --> 01:08:51,520
Something like, uh...

1246
01:08:51,522 --> 01:08:53,625
Put this down.

1247
01:08:55,592 --> 01:08:57,126
"Dear Dolores."

1248
01:08:57,128 --> 01:08:59,561
Hold on. I'll start a new one.

1249
01:08:59,563 --> 01:09:02,734
"D-E-A-R Dolores."

1250
01:09:04,803 --> 01:09:07,870
"When I think of you,

1251
01:09:07,872 --> 01:09:12,574
I'm reminded of
the beautiful plains of Iowa."

1252
01:09:12,576 --> 01:09:14,077
What planes?

1253
01:09:14,079 --> 01:09:15,878
The plains.

1254
01:09:15,880 --> 01:09:17,613
P-L-A-I-N-S.

1255
01:09:17,615 --> 01:09:18,881
Those big fields we saw.

1256
01:09:18,883 --> 01:09:21,117
Oh. Yeah, those were nice.

1257
01:09:21,119 --> 01:09:23,152
Plains.

1258
01:09:23,154 --> 01:09:26,889
"Which is what they call...

1259
01:09:26,891 --> 01:09:30,559
big fields around here."

1260
01:09:30,561 --> 01:09:32,561
Tony, no expounding.

1261
01:09:32,563 --> 01:09:34,897
- No what?
- Just write what I say.

1262
01:09:34,899 --> 01:09:36,766
No good.

1263
01:09:36,768 --> 01:09:40,036
"The distance between us...

1264
01:09:40,038 --> 01:09:42,674
is breaking my spirit."

1265
01:09:43,908 --> 01:09:46,075
"Between us..."

1266
01:09:46,077 --> 01:09:48,711
"My time and experiences
without you

1267
01:09:48,713 --> 01:09:50,749
"are meaningless to me.

1268
01:09:54,052 --> 01:09:55,852
"Falling in love with you

1269
01:09:55,854 --> 01:09:58,788
was the easiest thing
I've ever done."

1270
01:09:58,790 --> 01:10:03,092
"Falling in love with you..."

1271
01:10:03,094 --> 01:10:06,595
This is very fucking romantic.

1272
01:10:06,597 --> 01:10:08,064
<i>...was the easiest thing</i>

1273
01:10:08,066 --> 01:10:09,899
<i>I have ever done.</i>

1274
01:10:09,901 --> 01:10:12,902
<i>Nothing matters to me but you,</i>

1275
01:10:12,904 --> 01:10:16,105
<i>and every day I'm alive,
I'm aware of this.</i>

1276
01:10:16,107 --> 01:10:20,376
<i>I loved you the day I met you,
I love you today,</i>

1277
01:10:20,378 --> 01:10:23,882
<i>and I will love you
the rest of my life.</i>

1278
01:10:26,217 --> 01:10:28,851
So, can I put, uh...
"P.S. Kiss the kids"?

1279
01:10:28,853 --> 01:10:30,186
A P.S.?

1280
01:10:30,188 --> 01:10:31,923
Yeah, like, at the end.

1281
01:10:32,957 --> 01:10:34,791
That's like clanging a cowbell

1282
01:10:34,793 --> 01:10:36,928
at the end
of Shostakovich's Seventh.

1283
01:10:38,696 --> 01:10:40,698
Right. And that's good?

1284
01:10:41,833 --> 01:10:43,802
It's perfect, Tony.

1285
01:10:47,405 --> 01:10:50,406
Everybody talks
about Willie Mays, 1954.

1286
01:10:50,408 --> 01:10:52,708
It wasn't even the greatest
catch in the Polo Grounds.

1287
01:10:52,710 --> 01:10:55,678
That was Joe DiMaggio, 1936,

1288
01:10:55,680 --> 01:10:57,013
second game
of the World Series.

1289
01:10:57,015 --> 01:10:59,984
Final out, 500 feet...

1290
01:11:03,021 --> 01:11:04,921
You like that, Doc?

1291
01:11:04,923 --> 01:11:06,122
That's a handsome suit.

1292
01:11:06,124 --> 01:11:08,724
- Sharp.
- Mm-hmm.

1293
01:11:08,726 --> 01:11:11,027
Guy looks just like you.

1294
01:11:11,029 --> 01:11:12,964
He does?

1295
01:11:14,132 --> 01:11:16,634
Well, size-wise. Yeah.

1296
01:11:18,870 --> 01:11:20,970
It is about a 42.

1297
01:11:20,972 --> 01:11:24,040
- Why don't you try it on?
- Hmm...

1298
01:11:24,042 --> 01:11:27,076
What, you gotta wear
a tuxedo onstage every night?

1299
01:11:27,078 --> 01:11:29,045
You could mix it up
a little, Doc.

1300
01:11:29,047 --> 01:11:30,913
Come on, let's see
how it looks on you.

1301
01:11:30,915 --> 01:11:32,048
We got plenty of time.

1302
01:11:34,853 --> 01:11:36,452
I'll be right back.

1303
01:11:36,454 --> 01:11:39,288
- How you doing?
- May I help you, sir?

1304
01:11:39,290 --> 01:11:41,157
Yeah, we want
to try on that, uh,

1305
01:11:41,159 --> 01:11:42,859
beautiful gray suit
in the window.

1306
01:11:42,861 --> 01:11:44,127
You got it in a 42?

1307
01:11:44,129 --> 01:11:46,030
Of course.

1308
01:11:48,199 --> 01:11:49,899
That's the one.

1309
01:11:49,901 --> 01:11:51,767
Dressing room
is in the back, sir.

1310
01:11:51,769 --> 01:11:53,136
Thank you.

1311
01:11:53,138 --> 01:11:55,471
- I'll be just a moment.
- Take your time, Doc.

1312
01:11:55,473 --> 01:11:57,208
I'll check out
some ties for you.

1313
01:11:58,776 --> 01:12:00,776
Uh, e-excuse me.

1314
01:12:00,778 --> 01:12:03,148
Uh, you're not allowed
to try that on.

1315
01:12:04,782 --> 01:12:06,115
I beg your pardon?

1316
01:12:06,117 --> 01:12:08,484
Uh, if you'd like
to purchase it first,

1317
01:12:08,486 --> 01:12:11,189
we'd be happy
to tailor it to your needs.

1318
01:12:13,291 --> 01:12:16,027
I see.

1319
01:13:17,121 --> 01:13:18,823
Yeah.

1320
01:13:19,958 --> 01:13:21,793
That's me.

1321
01:13:32,370 --> 01:13:34,136
Hey, Officer.

1322
01:13:34,138 --> 01:13:36,239
I got a call about Dr. Shirley.

1323
01:13:36,241 --> 01:13:38,276
Come on.

1324
01:13:42,947 --> 01:13:45,281
His friend's here.

1325
01:13:45,283 --> 01:13:47,283
Thank you.

1326
01:13:51,889 --> 01:13:54,323
Get a guy a towel,
for Christ's sake.

1327
01:13:54,325 --> 01:13:56,025
You a lawyer?

1328
01:13:56,027 --> 01:13:57,293
- No.
- Well, you should call one.

1329
01:13:57,295 --> 01:13:59,228
- We're taking your auntie in.
- For what?

1330
01:13:59,230 --> 01:14:02,033
Manager caught him
and the other guy.

1331
01:14:05,403 --> 01:14:08,004
Well, can we get
the cuffs off him,

1332
01:14:08,006 --> 01:14:10,239
let him put his pants on,
we talk about this?

1333
01:14:10,241 --> 01:14:11,907
Sure, we could.

1334
01:14:11,909 --> 01:14:13,876
But we ain't.

1335
01:14:13,878 --> 01:14:16,912
Okay, look, we're out of here
tomorrow morning.

1336
01:14:16,914 --> 01:14:18,347
You'll never see us again.

1337
01:14:18,349 --> 01:14:20,918
There's gotta be something
we can do to work this out.

1338
01:14:22,887 --> 01:14:24,053
What if you let him go

1339
01:14:24,055 --> 01:14:26,188
and I give you something
to thank you?

1340
01:14:27,425 --> 01:14:29,425
- You bribing us?
- No.

1341
01:14:29,427 --> 01:14:30,860
Hell no.

1342
01:14:30,862 --> 01:14:32,028
A gift.

1343
01:14:32,030 --> 01:14:33,329
A thank-you.

1344
01:14:33,331 --> 01:14:35,865
What kind of thank-you?

1345
01:14:35,867 --> 01:14:37,400
Like a...

1346
01:14:37,402 --> 01:14:39,368
you know, donation
to the police force.

1347
01:14:39,370 --> 01:14:41,070
Youse guys.

1348
01:14:41,072 --> 01:14:43,139
Whatever you want.

1349
01:14:43,141 --> 01:14:45,908
You like suits?

1350
01:14:45,910 --> 01:14:48,010
I was walking through
your nice town today,

1351
01:14:48,012 --> 01:14:51,047
and I seen a store
that was selling suits.

1352
01:14:51,049 --> 01:14:52,915
Primo suits.

1353
01:14:52,917 --> 01:14:56,385
What if, as a thank-you...
a donation...

1354
01:14:56,387 --> 01:14:59,355
I buy youse each a suit?

1355
01:14:59,357 --> 01:15:01,157
You get all dressed up,

1356
01:15:01,159 --> 01:15:03,359
you take the wife out
for dinner.

1357
01:15:03,361 --> 01:15:05,361
I mean, guys like you,
you work hard.

1358
01:15:05,363 --> 01:15:07,365
You deserve it.

1359
01:15:14,038 --> 01:15:16,038
They were wrong
for the way they treated me,

1360
01:15:16,040 --> 01:15:18,109
and you rewarded them.

1361
01:15:19,911 --> 01:15:22,244
I was hired to get you
from one show to the next.

1362
01:15:22,246 --> 01:15:24,080
How I do it
shouldn't matter to you.

1363
01:15:24,082 --> 01:15:25,948
I just wish you hadn't
paid 'em off.

1364
01:15:25,950 --> 01:15:28,284
I did what I had to do.

1365
01:15:28,286 --> 01:15:30,687
You know, if this got out,
it would kill your career.

1366
01:15:30,689 --> 01:15:32,988
Okay, Tony.

1367
01:15:32,990 --> 01:15:35,024
I need you to stop it
with the phony altruism

1368
01:15:35,026 --> 01:15:36,459
and concern for my career.

1369
01:15:36,461 --> 01:15:38,194
What the hell does that mean?

1370
01:15:38,196 --> 01:15:39,995
You were only thinking
about yourself back there

1371
01:15:39,997 --> 01:15:41,397
because you know,
if I miss a show,

1372
01:15:41,399 --> 01:15:42,998
it'll come out
of your pocketbook.

1373
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,034
Of course I don't want you
to miss a show,

1374
01:15:45,036 --> 01:15:46,235
you ungrateful bastard.

1375
01:15:46,237 --> 01:15:48,337
You think I'm doing this
for my health?

1376
01:15:48,339 --> 01:15:50,406
Tonight, I saved your ass.

1377
01:15:50,408 --> 01:15:53,109
So show a little
appreciation, maybe.

1378
01:15:53,111 --> 01:15:57,413
Besides, I told you never
to go nowhere without me!

1379
01:15:57,415 --> 01:16:01,450
I assumed you'd want this
to be the exception.

1380
01:16:36,020 --> 01:16:38,320
Want me to get some makeup
or something

1381
01:16:38,322 --> 01:16:39,555
for the show tomorrow?

1382
01:16:39,557 --> 01:16:41,157
No, I'm fine.

1383
01:16:41,159 --> 01:16:43,325
You sure? Bruise kind of shows.

1384
01:16:43,327 --> 01:16:44,529
I said I'm fine.

1385
01:16:46,063 --> 01:16:48,032
Okay.

1386
01:16:54,472 --> 01:16:56,305
He didn't ask me to do that.

1387
01:16:56,307 --> 01:16:58,474
Dom, I'm telling you,
that's what he told me.

1388
01:16:58,476 --> 01:17:00,075
He didn't ask me.

1389
01:17:00,077 --> 01:17:02,578
Oh. Tony Lip.

1390
01:17:02,580 --> 01:17:04,180
- Dominic, Mags.
- What the hell...?

1391
01:17:04,182 --> 01:17:05,548
What the hell you guys
doing down here?

1392
01:17:05,550 --> 01:17:07,082
Hey, Brooklyn sent us down.

1393
01:17:07,084 --> 01:17:09,287
- Take care of a few things.
- Yeah.

1394
01:17:44,121 --> 01:17:45,958
I'm working here.

1395
01:17:54,833 --> 01:17:57,399
Sorry, Doc. They're some
friends from New York.

1396
01:17:57,401 --> 01:17:59,401
Hey, can you get
Dr. Shirley's luggage?

1397
01:17:59,403 --> 01:18:00,505
All right.

1398
01:18:33,337 --> 01:18:34,671
Called his room.

1399
01:18:34,673 --> 01:18:36,507
Be down in a minute.

1400
01:18:45,249 --> 01:18:46,616
Hey, Doc.

1401
01:18:46,618 --> 01:18:48,486
Where are you off to?

1402
01:18:50,121 --> 01:18:52,154
Just going downstairs.

1403
01:18:52,156 --> 01:18:54,091
To have a drink.

1404
01:19:04,402 --> 01:19:06,201
Tony...

1405
01:19:06,203 --> 01:19:09,906
I think you're doing
a wonderful job.

1406
01:19:09,908 --> 01:19:12,174
So...

1407
01:19:12,176 --> 01:19:13,677
I'd like to formally offer you

1408
01:19:13,679 --> 01:19:15,477
the position
of my road manager.

1409
01:19:15,479 --> 01:19:20,382
With the title also comes
more responsibility, but...

1410
01:19:20,384 --> 01:19:22,386
that also means a raise in pay.

1411
01:19:23,454 --> 01:19:25,554
No. No.

1412
01:19:25,556 --> 01:19:28,524
No, thanks.

1413
01:19:28,526 --> 01:19:32,696
We agreed on 125 a week,
plus expenses.

1414
01:19:32,698 --> 01:19:35,634
That's our deal, right?

1415
01:19:37,301 --> 01:19:39,234
I ain't going nowhere, Doc.

1416
01:19:39,236 --> 01:19:41,539
I-I was just going down
to tell them.

1417
01:19:52,216 --> 01:19:53,384
Tony.

1418
01:19:58,255 --> 01:20:00,626
I'm sorry about last night.

1419
01:20:03,762 --> 01:20:06,197
Don't worry about it.

1420
01:20:07,733 --> 01:20:11,200
I've been working nightclubs
in New York City my whole life.

1421
01:20:11,202 --> 01:20:15,272
I know it's a...
complicated world.

1422
01:20:27,518 --> 01:20:29,251
<i>So, where'd you learn</i>

1423
01:20:29,253 --> 01:20:30,486
how to play like that?

1424
01:20:30,488 --> 01:20:32,421
- My mother.
- Your mother?

1425
01:20:32,423 --> 01:20:34,392
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

1426
01:20:36,260 --> 01:20:39,696
She taught me how to play
on an old spinet.

1427
01:20:39,698 --> 01:20:42,264
Soon as I could walk, we'd...

1428
01:20:42,266 --> 01:20:44,500
travel around
the Florida Panhandle,

1429
01:20:44,502 --> 01:20:48,237
put on my little shows
in parishes and halls.

1430
01:20:48,239 --> 01:20:50,439
Fortunately,
a man who had seen me play

1431
01:20:50,441 --> 01:20:51,708
arranged for me to study

1432
01:20:51,710 --> 01:20:53,743
at the Leningrad Conservatory
of Music.

1433
01:20:53,745 --> 01:20:56,578
I was the first Negro
ever accepted there.

1434
01:20:56,580 --> 01:20:59,015
That's where they taught you
all them songs you play?

1435
01:20:59,017 --> 01:21:02,251
Actually, I was trained
to play classical music.

1436
01:21:02,253 --> 01:21:06,524
Brahms, Franz Liszt,
Beethoven, Chopin.

1437
01:21:07,591 --> 01:21:09,859
It's all I ever wanted to play.

1438
01:21:09,861 --> 01:21:12,796
But I was persuaded
by my record company

1439
01:21:12,798 --> 01:21:16,666
to pursue a career
in popular music instead.

1440
01:21:16,668 --> 01:21:19,268
They insisted that audiences
would never accept

1441
01:21:19,270 --> 01:21:21,437
a Negro pianist
on a classical stage.

1442
01:21:21,439 --> 01:21:26,341
Wanted to turn me into just
another colored entertainer.

1443
01:21:26,343 --> 01:21:29,746
You know, the guy who's smoking
while he's playing

1444
01:21:29,748 --> 01:21:32,615
and sets a glass of whiskey
on his piano,

1445
01:21:32,617 --> 01:21:35,350
and then complains
because he's not respected

1446
01:21:35,352 --> 01:21:36,753
like Arthur Rubinstein.

1447
01:21:36,755 --> 01:21:39,656
You don't see Arthur Rubinstein

1448
01:21:39,658 --> 01:21:42,293
putting a glass of whiskey
on his piano.

1449
01:21:43,628 --> 01:21:45,662
I don't know.
Personally, I think,

1450
01:21:45,664 --> 01:21:47,463
if you stuck
to the classic stuff,

1451
01:21:47,465 --> 01:21:49,065
it would've been a big mistake.

1452
01:21:49,067 --> 01:21:50,667
A mistake?

1453
01:21:50,669 --> 01:21:53,903
Performing the music I trained
my entire life to play?

1454
01:21:53,905 --> 01:21:56,505
Trained?
What are you, a seal?

1455
01:21:56,507 --> 01:21:58,373
People love what you do.

1456
01:21:58,375 --> 01:22:00,810
Anyone could sound
like Beethoven or...

1457
01:22:00,812 --> 01:22:03,378
"Joe Pan"
or them other guys you said,

1458
01:22:03,380 --> 01:22:07,318
but your music, what you do...

1459
01:22:08,754 --> 01:22:10,554
...only you can do that.

1460
01:22:13,424 --> 01:22:14,793
Thank you, Tony.

1461
01:22:19,798 --> 01:22:22,433
But not everyone
can play Chopin.

1462
01:22:23,534 --> 01:22:25,536
Not like I can.

1463
01:22:26,805 --> 01:22:29,338

Let's give our finest

to Don Shirley

Your mother's ass.

1491
01:24:38,837 --> 01:24:41,004
Can't see shit.

1492
01:24:48,479 --> 01:24:50,479
What the hell's this guy doing?

1493
01:24:53,919 --> 01:24:56,021
Son of a bitch.

1494
01:25:08,499 --> 01:25:10,099
License and papers.

1495
01:25:10,101 --> 01:25:13,036
Am I glad to see you.

1496
01:25:13,038 --> 01:25:14,871
We had to turn
off the main road,

1497
01:25:14,873 --> 01:25:17,842
and, uh, now we're lost.

1498
01:25:19,543 --> 01:25:21,543
Step out of the car.

1499
01:25:21,545 --> 01:25:22,879
What'd I do?

1500
01:25:22,881 --> 01:25:24,716
Out of the car.

1501
01:25:35,860 --> 01:25:37,927
Why are you on this road?

1502
01:25:37,929 --> 01:25:39,295
I told you.

1503
01:25:39,297 --> 01:25:42,867
We had to make a detour,
and we got lost.

1504
01:25:47,305 --> 01:25:49,138
And why are you driving him?

1505
01:25:49,140 --> 01:25:51,743
He's my boss.

1506
01:25:57,548 --> 01:25:59,615
He can't be out here at night.

1507
01:25:59,617 --> 01:26:01,550
This is a sundown town.

1508
01:26:01,552 --> 01:26:02,854
What's that?

1509
01:26:04,155 --> 01:26:06,956
Get him out of the car
and check his I.D.

1510
01:26:06,958 --> 01:26:08,124
Oh, come on.

1511
01:26:08,126 --> 01:26:09,258
It's pouring rain.

1512
01:26:09,260 --> 01:26:12,594
Sir, I can just get it
right here through the window.

1513
01:26:12,596 --> 01:26:13,796
Get him out of the car.

1514
01:26:13,798 --> 01:26:15,665
Come on, get out, now.

1515
01:26:15,667 --> 01:26:17,566
Get out, now. Get out.

1516
01:26:17,568 --> 01:26:19,971
Got I.D.?

1517
01:26:22,007 --> 01:26:24,974
How you say this last name?

1518
01:26:24,976 --> 01:26:27,110
Vallelonga.

1519
01:26:27,112 --> 01:26:29,578
Yeah, what kind of name
is that?

1520
01:26:29,580 --> 01:26:30,947
It's Italian.

1521
01:26:30,949 --> 01:26:32,081
Oh.

1522
01:26:32,083 --> 01:26:33,683
Oh, I see.

1523
01:26:33,685 --> 01:26:35,987
That's why
you're driving him around.

1524
01:26:38,023 --> 01:26:39,789
You're half a nigger yourself.

1525
01:26:40,792 --> 01:26:42,625
Hands in the air!

1526
01:26:42,627 --> 01:26:43,928
Now! Now!

1527
01:26:47,665 --> 01:26:49,566
Excuse me.

1528
01:26:52,837 --> 01:26:56,606
Excuse me, sirs.

1529
01:26:56,608 --> 01:26:59,809
I-I understand why my associate
is being held,

1530
01:26:59,811 --> 01:27:02,781
but what exactly am I
being charged with?

1531
01:27:05,683 --> 01:27:08,885
You seem like reasonable men.

1532
01:27:08,887 --> 01:27:10,186
Perhaps you could let me out

1533
01:27:10,188 --> 01:27:12,688
so that we could discuss
the situation further.

1534
01:27:12,690 --> 01:27:14,624
Just put the apple butter
away, boy.

1535
01:27:14,626 --> 01:27:17,627
You ain't going nowhere
no time soon.

1536
01:27:17,629 --> 01:27:20,730
You cannot hold me
without cause.

1537
01:27:20,732 --> 01:27:22,065
Well, I got cause.

1538
01:27:22,067 --> 01:27:24,836
'Cause you let the sun set
on your black ass.

1539
01:27:26,171 --> 01:27:28,771
I want to speak to my lawyer.

1540
01:27:28,773 --> 01:27:30,940
I want my call.

1541
01:27:30,942 --> 01:27:34,210
This is a flagrant violation
of my rights.

1542
01:27:34,212 --> 01:27:37,647
You know...

1543
01:27:37,649 --> 01:27:41,786
he does have, uh, rights.

1544
01:27:46,224 --> 01:27:49,659
Give the Negro
his goddamn phone call.

1545
01:27:49,661 --> 01:27:51,129
You happy?

1546
01:27:55,667 --> 01:27:57,433
You know a lawyer?

1547
01:27:57,435 --> 01:27:58,837
Call him.

1548
01:28:10,248 --> 01:28:11,981
I walk up
to the car, and I say,

1549
01:28:11,983 --> 01:28:13,850
"Sir, you know
how fast you were going?"

1550
01:28:13,852 --> 01:28:16,119
He says, "I'm sorry, Officer.
I didn't mean to speed, but..."

1551
01:28:16,121 --> 01:28:17,753
As my mother always said,

1552
01:28:17,755 --> 01:28:20,223
"What kind
of brand-new fool are you?"

1553
01:28:20,225 --> 01:28:22,191
Look at them over there.

1554
01:28:22,193 --> 01:28:24,827
Take a good look
at the officer you hit.

1555
01:28:24,829 --> 01:28:27,196
Look at him. He's over there
having a grand old time,

1556
01:28:27,198 --> 01:28:31,467
chatting up with his pals,
enjoying a nice cup of coffee.

1557
01:28:31,469 --> 01:28:33,703
And where are you?

1558
01:28:33,705 --> 01:28:36,706
In here, with me,
who did nothing.

1559
01:28:36,708 --> 01:28:39,008
Yet I'm the one
who pays the price.

1560
01:28:39,010 --> 01:28:41,911
I'm the one who's gonna miss
the Birmingham show.

1561
01:28:41,913 --> 01:28:43,813
Hey, I'm gonna lose
a lot of money, too,

1562
01:28:43,815 --> 01:28:45,214
if you don't play Birmingham.

1563
01:28:45,216 --> 01:28:48,686
So that little temper tantrum,
was it worth it?

1564
01:28:49,787 --> 01:28:51,787
Hmm?

1565
01:28:51,789 --> 01:28:53,789
You never win
with violence, Tony.

1566
01:28:53,791 --> 01:28:55,958
You only win when you maintain
your dignity.

1567
01:28:55,960 --> 01:29:00,062
Dignity always prevails.

1568
01:29:00,064 --> 01:29:03,268
And tonight,
because of you, we did not.

1569
01:29:08,139 --> 01:29:10,773
I wouldn't touch
that mattress, Doc.

1570
01:29:10,775 --> 01:29:13,111
Maryville Police.

1571
01:29:15,847 --> 01:29:17,747
No, sir.

1572
01:29:17,749 --> 01:29:20,183
No, no, I-I'm not, sir.

1573
01:29:20,185 --> 01:29:22,985
Yes, sir.
He's right here, sir. Yes, sir.

1574
01:29:22,987 --> 01:29:24,086
Yes, sir.

1575
01:29:24,088 --> 01:29:26,255
Give me.

1576
01:29:26,257 --> 01:29:28,224
Chief Pratt. Who's this?

1577
01:29:28,226 --> 01:29:30,161
Baloney.

1578
01:29:32,363 --> 01:29:33,963
Yes, sir.

1579
01:29:33,965 --> 01:29:37,233
I can hear it now, Governor.

1580
01:29:37,235 --> 01:29:39,969
Uh...

1581
01:29:39,971 --> 01:29:41,871
No, sir, I'm sorry. I...

1582
01:29:41,873 --> 01:29:44,242
No, of course I can recognize
your voice. It's...

1583
01:29:47,278 --> 01:29:49,278
Sir?

1584
01:29:49,280 --> 01:29:53,117
You're saying the boy
we got locked up called who?

1585
01:29:56,120 --> 01:29:58,120
Oh, and he called you.

1586
01:29:58,122 --> 01:30:00,056
No, no, sir.

1587
01:30:00,058 --> 01:30:03,228
An officer was assaulted
in the line of duty.

1588
01:30:05,997 --> 01:30:08,898
No, sir. No.
I don't want no National Guard

1589
01:30:08,900 --> 01:30:10,866
coming down here, neither, sir.

1590
01:30:10,868 --> 01:30:13,271
I'll get to it immediately,
Governor.

1591
01:30:14,572 --> 01:30:17,008
Good night to you
and the missus.

1592
01:30:21,112 --> 01:30:22,878
- Get 'em out.
- What?

1593
01:30:22,880 --> 01:30:24,213
Cut 'em goddamn loose.

1594
01:30:24,215 --> 01:30:26,282
That dago wop hit me!

1595
01:30:26,284 --> 01:30:28,017
You want to keep
your goddamn job?

1596
01:30:28,019 --> 01:30:30,052
Then you do what I goddamn
tell you to do

1597
01:30:30,054 --> 01:30:32,154
when I goddamn tell you
to do it!

1598
01:30:32,156 --> 01:30:35,157
And I'm telling you
to get 'em the goddamn out!

1599
01:30:35,159 --> 01:30:36,928
Who the hell did you call?

1600
01:30:38,930 --> 01:30:42,265
Bobby Kennedy
just saved our asses.

1601
01:30:42,267 --> 01:30:45,401
Madonne. <i>How great is that?</i>

1602
01:30:45,403 --> 01:30:47,036
It's not great.

1603
01:30:47,038 --> 01:30:48,605
It's not great at all.

1604
01:30:48,607 --> 01:30:50,973
- It's humiliating.
- The hell you talking about?

1605
01:30:50,975 --> 01:30:53,409
We were screwed. Now we ain't.

1606
01:30:53,411 --> 01:30:56,145
And I just put the attorney
general of the United States

1607
01:30:56,147 --> 01:30:57,346
in an incredibly awkward
position.

1608
01:30:57,348 --> 01:30:58,914
So what?

1609
01:30:58,916 --> 01:31:00,283
That's what the guy
gets paid for.

1610
01:31:00,285 --> 01:31:01,917
What else he got to do?

1611
01:31:01,919 --> 01:31:04,320
That man and his brother

1612
01:31:04,322 --> 01:31:05,921
are trying to change
this country.

1613
01:31:05,923 --> 01:31:08,357
That's what else he got to do.

1614
01:31:08,359 --> 01:31:11,994
Now he thinks
I'm some kind of...

1615
01:31:11,996 --> 01:31:15,398
Calling from some
backwoods swamp jail,

1616
01:31:15,400 --> 01:31:18,868
asking to attenuate
assault charges? Who does that?

1617
01:31:18,870 --> 01:31:21,103
Garbage. That's who.

1618
01:31:21,105 --> 01:31:22,471
You shouldn't have hit him.

1619
01:31:22,473 --> 01:31:24,273
I didn't like the way
he was treating you.

1620
01:31:24,275 --> 01:31:26,075
Making you stand out
in the rain like that.

1621
01:31:26,077 --> 01:31:29,178
Please, you hit him
because of what he called you.

1622
01:31:29,180 --> 01:31:31,314
I've had to endure that kind
of talk my entire life.

1623
01:31:31,316 --> 01:31:33,449
You should be able to take it
for at least one night.

1624
01:31:33,451 --> 01:31:35,451
What? I can't get mad
at that stuff he was saying

1625
01:31:35,453 --> 01:31:36,986
'cause I ain't black?

1626
01:31:36,988 --> 01:31:38,220
Christ, I'm blacker
than you are.

1627
01:31:38,222 --> 01:31:39,922
- Excuse me?
- You don't know shit

1628
01:31:39,924 --> 01:31:41,424
about your own people.

1629
01:31:41,426 --> 01:31:44,927
What they eat, how they talk,
how they live.

1630
01:31:44,929 --> 01:31:46,495
You don't even know who
Little Richard is.

1631
01:31:46,497 --> 01:31:47,963
Oh, so knowing
who Little Richard is

1632
01:31:47,965 --> 01:31:49,031
makes you blacker than me?

1633
01:31:49,033 --> 01:31:52,134
Oh, Tony, I wish you could
hear yourself sometimes.

1634
01:31:52,136 --> 01:31:54,103
You wouldn't talk so damn much.

1635
01:31:54,105 --> 01:31:55,171
Bullshit.

1636
01:31:55,173 --> 01:31:57,473
I know exactly who I am.

1637
01:31:57,475 --> 01:31:59,408
I'm the guy who lived
in the same neighborhood

1638
01:31:59,410 --> 01:32:01,977
in the Bronx my entire life
with my mother, my father,

1639
01:32:01,979 --> 01:32:03,680
my brother,
and now my wife and kids.

1640
01:32:03,682 --> 01:32:05,682
That's it. That's who I am.

1641
01:32:05,684 --> 01:32:08,150
I'm the asshole who has
to hustle every goddamn day

1642
01:32:08,152 --> 01:32:09,919
to put food on the table.

1643
01:32:09,921 --> 01:32:12,955
You, Mr. Big Shot,
you live on top of a castle,

1644
01:32:12,957 --> 01:32:15,491
traveling around the world
doing concerts for rich people.

1645
01:32:15,493 --> 01:32:18,194
I live on the streets.
You sit on a throne.

1646
01:32:18,196 --> 01:32:21,065
So yeah, my world is way more
blacker than yours.

1647
01:32:22,233 --> 01:32:24,100
Pull over.

1648
01:32:24,102 --> 01:32:25,267
What?

1649
01:32:25,269 --> 01:32:27,269
- Pull over.
- I ain't pulling over.

1650
01:32:27,271 --> 01:32:29,140
Stop the car, Tony!

1651
01:32:31,542 --> 01:32:33,042
What?

1652
01:32:33,044 --> 01:32:35,211
What are you doing?

1653
01:32:35,213 --> 01:32:37,048
Doc.

1654
01:32:39,016 --> 01:32:41,117
Doc, what the hell
are you doing?

1655
01:32:41,119 --> 01:32:42,151
Doc.

1656
01:32:42,153 --> 01:32:44,053
Get back in the car.

1657
01:32:44,055 --> 01:32:46,891
Yes, I live in a castle, Tony!
Alone.

1658
01:32:49,060 --> 01:32:51,260
And rich white people pay me
to play piano for them

1659
01:32:51,262 --> 01:32:53,062
because it makes them
feel cultured.

1660
01:32:53,064 --> 01:32:55,531
But as soon as I step off
that stage, I go right back

1661
01:32:55,533 --> 01:32:58,000
to being just another nigger
to them.

1662
01:32:58,002 --> 01:33:00,035
Because that is
their true culture.

1663
01:33:00,037 --> 01:33:02,071
And I suffer that slight alone,

1664
01:33:02,073 --> 01:33:03,572
because I'm not accepted
by my own people

1665
01:33:03,574 --> 01:33:06,108
'cause I'm not like them,
either.

1666
01:33:06,110 --> 01:33:09,311
So, if I'm not black enough
and if I'm not white enough

1667
01:33:09,313 --> 01:33:13,151
and if I'm not man enough,
then tell me, Tony, what am I?

1668
01:33:47,084 --> 01:33:49,086
I need some sleep.

1669
01:33:52,223 --> 01:33:54,223
All right.

1670
01:33:54,225 --> 01:33:56,225
I'll stop at the next place
we see

1671
01:33:56,227 --> 01:33:57,493
and sneak you into my room.

1672
01:33:57,495 --> 01:33:59,261
No. No.

1673
01:33:59,263 --> 01:34:01,363
I refuse to stay
in an establishment

1674
01:34:01,365 --> 01:34:03,234
where I'm not welcome.

1675
01:34:05,303 --> 01:34:07,238
Yeah. Okay.

1676
01:34:25,256 --> 01:34:27,492
Tony, do you have
to smoke everywhere?

1677
01:34:29,828 --> 01:34:32,194
I didn't know it bothered you.

1678
01:34:32,196 --> 01:34:35,164
You should have told me.

1679
01:34:35,166 --> 01:34:37,435
All you gotta do
is say the word, Doc.

1680
01:34:49,848 --> 01:34:53,282
You do realize you'll be home
before that letter arrives.

1681
01:34:53,284 --> 01:34:54,851
Yeah, I know.

1682
01:34:54,853 --> 01:34:56,552
Just thought I'd bring it
with me.

1683
01:34:56,554 --> 01:34:59,121
Save on stamps.

1684
01:34:59,123 --> 01:35:00,624
All right.

1685
01:35:00,626 --> 01:35:03,094
Tony, give it here.
I'll fix it.

1686
01:35:04,128 --> 01:35:05,862
No offense, Doc,

1687
01:35:05,864 --> 01:35:09,033
but I think
I got the hang of it now.

1688
01:35:15,206 --> 01:35:17,139
"Dear Dolores:

1689
01:35:17,141 --> 01:35:20,344
"Sometimes you remind me
of a house.

1690
01:35:22,580 --> 01:35:26,248
"A house with
beautiful lights on it,

1691
01:35:26,250 --> 01:35:29,253
where everyone
is happy inside."

1692
01:35:34,158 --> 01:35:36,626
Yes, Tony. You got it.

1693
01:35:36,628 --> 01:35:39,194
Yeah?

1694
01:35:40,498 --> 01:35:43,167
Thanks.

1695
01:35:44,703 --> 01:35:49,471
Hey, Doc, thanks for helping me
with, uh, the letters.

1696
01:35:49,473 --> 01:35:52,274
You're really good
at writing 'em.

1697
01:35:52,276 --> 01:35:54,445
My pleasure, Tony.

1698
01:35:55,614 --> 01:35:57,580
You know, um,
when you get home,

1699
01:35:57,582 --> 01:36:01,519
maybe you should write...
write one to your brother.

1700
01:36:03,521 --> 01:36:06,723
He knows where I am
if he ever wants to reconnect.

1701
01:36:06,725 --> 01:36:09,427
Eh. I wouldn't wait.

1702
01:36:10,729 --> 01:36:14,229
You know, world's full
of lonely people

1703
01:36:14,231 --> 01:36:16,233
afraid to make the first move.

1704
01:36:23,609 --> 01:36:26,444
Yeah, I'll finish this
tomorrow.

1705
01:36:37,388 --> 01:36:41,390
You know, Doc, something's been
eating at me this whole trip.

1706
01:36:41,392 --> 01:36:43,361
Hmm?

1707
01:36:44,763 --> 01:36:47,731
That Titsburgh
was a major disappointment.

1708
01:36:47,733 --> 01:36:49,599
I didn't notice
any difference at all.

1709
01:36:49,601 --> 01:36:51,266
Did you?

1710
01:36:51,268 --> 01:36:53,270
Good night, Tony.

1711
01:37:04,281 --> 01:37:06,582
- Good evening.
- Welcome, welcome.

1712
01:37:06,584 --> 01:37:08,319
Come on in.

1713
01:37:10,622 --> 01:37:13,659
All righty.

1714
01:37:15,493 --> 01:37:17,326
Welcome, Mr. Shirley.

1715
01:37:17,328 --> 01:37:19,428
Graham Kindell.
I'm the general manager.

1716
01:37:19,430 --> 01:37:20,697
It is a pleasure to meet you.

1717
01:37:20,699 --> 01:37:22,431
Thank you, Mr. Kindell.

1718
01:37:22,433 --> 01:37:23,800
This is Mr. Tony Vallelonga.

1719
01:37:23,802 --> 01:37:25,567
- Nice to meet you, Tony.
- How you doing?

1720
01:37:25,569 --> 01:37:27,236
Uh, let's keep the car
right here

1721
01:37:27,238 --> 01:37:28,537
in our "guest of honor" spot.

1722
01:37:28,539 --> 01:37:29,806
Right this way, gentlemen.

1723
01:37:29,808 --> 01:37:31,573
- Hmm. Nice.
- How was your drive up?

1724
01:37:31,575 --> 01:37:32,742
Oh, it was wonderful.

1725
01:37:32,744 --> 01:37:34,410
Good to hear. Good to hear.

1726
01:37:34,412 --> 01:37:35,845
Now, as you can imagine,
our Christmas show

1727
01:37:35,847 --> 01:37:37,579
is our biggest show
of the year,

1728
01:37:37,581 --> 01:37:39,816
and we are so happy
to have you here, Mr. Shirley.

1729
01:37:39,818 --> 01:37:41,316
So, if you need anything,

1730
01:37:41,318 --> 01:37:43,318
anything at all,
you let me know.

1731
01:37:43,320 --> 01:37:45,587
- Mm-hmm. Thank you.
- Now, here we are.

1732
01:37:45,589 --> 01:37:49,525
We got about an hour
before showtime. Any questions?

1733
01:37:49,527 --> 01:37:50,860
Where's the restaurant?

1734
01:37:50,862 --> 01:37:52,796
Well, you continue
down the hall here, Tony,

1735
01:37:52,798 --> 01:37:54,798
to the right
and across the lobby.

1736
01:37:54,800 --> 01:37:57,334
- Good luck. Break a leg.
- Thank you.

1737
01:37:59,037 --> 01:38:01,270
Well, he said we got an hour.

1738
01:38:01,272 --> 01:38:02,639
You must be starving, Doc.

1739
01:38:02,641 --> 01:38:04,710
Go ahead. I'll meet you there.

1740
01:38:30,568 --> 01:38:32,236
May we join you?

1741
01:38:32,904 --> 01:38:34,773
Mm. Go ahead.

1742
01:38:40,544 --> 01:38:41,811
Cocktail, gentlemen?

1743
01:38:41,813 --> 01:38:43,512
I'm good.

1744
01:38:43,514 --> 01:38:44,748
Three shots vodka.

1745
01:38:44,750 --> 01:38:46,683
Oh.

1746
01:38:46,685 --> 01:38:48,918
Last show. Cold War over.

1747
01:38:48,920 --> 01:38:50,387
Time for truce.

1748
01:38:51,857 --> 01:38:53,857
Is Dr. Shirley
in his dressing room?

1749
01:38:53,859 --> 01:38:56,525
Yeah.
More like half a broom closet.

1750
01:38:56,527 --> 01:38:59,865
Tell you, I don't know
how he puts up with that shit.

1751
01:39:03,602 --> 01:39:07,670
Six years ago, in 1956,

1752
01:39:07,672 --> 01:39:10,372
Nat King Cole
was invited to perform

1753
01:39:10,374 --> 01:39:13,676
at the Municipal Auditorium
here in Birmingham.

1754
01:39:13,678 --> 01:39:16,679
Mr. Cole was the first Negro
asked to play

1755
01:39:16,681 --> 01:39:19,115
at a white establishment
in this city.

1756
01:39:19,117 --> 01:39:21,383
As soon as he started playing,
a group of men

1757
01:39:21,385 --> 01:39:23,554
attack him for playing
white people's music.

1758
01:39:24,890 --> 01:39:27,556
They pull him off stage

1759
01:39:27,558 --> 01:39:29,659
and beat him badly.

1760
01:39:29,661 --> 01:39:32,563
Jesus Christ.

1761
01:39:35,432 --> 01:39:40,469
You asked me once
why Dr. Shirley does this.

1762
01:39:40,471 --> 01:39:42,571
I tell you.

1763
01:39:42,573 --> 01:39:45,742
Because genius is not enough.

1764
01:39:45,744 --> 01:39:49,446
It takes courage
to change people's hearts.

1765
01:39:56,453 --> 01:39:57,622
Thanks.

1766
01:39:58,924 --> 01:40:01,590
Thank you.

1767
01:40:01,592 --> 01:40:02,725
No?

1768
01:40:04,830 --> 01:40:06,631
<i>Danke schön.</i>

1769
01:40:08,800 --> 01:40:10,800
- Good evening.
- Can I help you?

1770
01:40:10,802 --> 01:40:12,336
Oh, um...

1771
01:40:15,472 --> 01:40:17,439
Um, there.
Some friends of mine.

1772
01:40:17,441 --> 01:40:20,344
Uh, y-you-you can't come
in here.

1773
01:40:28,720 --> 01:40:30,820
- I understand, but...
- Hey. What's going on?

1774
01:40:30,822 --> 01:40:35,557
This... gentleman says that I'm
not permitted to dine here.

1775
01:40:35,559 --> 01:40:36,860
No, you don't understand.

1776
01:40:36,862 --> 01:40:38,527
He's playing tonight.
He's the main event.

1777
01:40:38,529 --> 01:40:40,529
- Come on.
- I-I'm sorry, but...

1778
01:40:40,531 --> 01:40:42,431
it is the policy
of the restaurant.

1779
01:40:42,433 --> 01:40:43,700
Everything all right?

1780
01:40:43,702 --> 01:40:45,500
Uh, no, it's not all right.

1781
01:40:45,502 --> 01:40:47,502
This guy's saying Dr. Shirley
can't eat here.

1782
01:40:47,504 --> 01:40:50,572
Oh, well, I apologize,
but...

1783
01:40:50,574 --> 01:40:52,976
these are long-standing
traditions, club rules.

1784
01:40:52,978 --> 01:40:54,543
I'm sure you understand.

1785
01:40:54,545 --> 01:40:56,779
No, I do not understand.

1786
01:40:56,781 --> 01:40:58,513
In 45 minutes,
I will be right up there

1787
01:40:58,515 --> 01:41:00,216
on that stage
entertaining your guests,

1788
01:41:00,218 --> 01:41:01,751
yet I can't eat here?

1789
01:41:01,753 --> 01:41:03,653
I'm sorry.

1790
01:41:03,655 --> 01:41:05,587
Wait a minute.
Are you telling me

1791
01:41:05,589 --> 01:41:07,023
the bozos in his band

1792
01:41:07,025 --> 01:41:09,792
and all these people
who came here to see him play,

1793
01:41:09,794 --> 01:41:12,461
they can eat here,
but the star of the show,

1794
01:41:12,463 --> 01:41:14,030
the-the parking spot of honor,
he can't?

1795
01:41:14,032 --> 01:41:16,531
I'm afraid not.

1796
01:41:16,533 --> 01:41:19,570
Well, he's gotta eat.
I mean, he's gotta have dinner.

1797
01:41:21,538 --> 01:41:23,538
Okay.
I'll tell you what.

1798
01:41:23,540 --> 01:41:25,574
Why don't we bring something
to his dressing room, huh?

1799
01:41:25,576 --> 01:41:26,843
John, show him a menu.

1800
01:41:26,845 --> 01:41:28,077
No.

1801
01:41:28,079 --> 01:41:30,916
I'm not eating
in that storage room.

1802
01:41:32,549 --> 01:41:34,751
Okay, uh, well, if you prefer,

1803
01:41:34,753 --> 01:41:36,085
there's a very popular
establishment

1804
01:41:36,087 --> 01:41:37,954
right down the road,
the Orange Bird,

1805
01:41:37,956 --> 01:41:39,925
they'd be happy to feed you.

1806
01:41:42,260 --> 01:41:44,694
Doc, come here.

1807
01:41:44,696 --> 01:41:46,561
Just one second, one second.

1808
01:41:46,563 --> 01:41:49,699
You know what, maybe that
other place is better anyway.

1809
01:41:49,701 --> 01:41:51,768
I mean, the dinner rolls here
are like rocks.

1810
01:41:51,770 --> 01:41:54,873
You just go over and...
you go over and come back.

1811
01:41:58,777 --> 01:42:00,777
It's the last show.

1812
01:42:00,779 --> 01:42:02,011
It's the bottom of the ninth.

1813
01:42:02,013 --> 01:42:03,746
Let's just get it over with,

1814
01:42:03,748 --> 01:42:06,515
and we can go home,
get away from these pricks.

1815
01:42:06,517 --> 01:42:07,850
Huh?

1816
01:42:07,852 --> 01:42:09,752
Ah, there you go.

1817
01:42:09,754 --> 01:42:12,057
The fish is wonderful tonight.

1818
01:42:17,062 --> 01:42:20,296
Either I eat in this room,

1819
01:42:20,298 --> 01:42:22,767
or I'm not performing tonight.

1820
01:42:26,604 --> 01:42:29,074
May I have a word with you?

1821
01:42:34,079 --> 01:42:35,747
No.

1822
01:42:40,919 --> 01:42:43,753
Mr. Villanueva,

1823
01:42:43,755 --> 01:42:45,855
you have to talk sense
to Mr. Shirley.

1824
01:42:45,857 --> 01:42:47,123
Please make him understand.

1825
01:42:47,125 --> 01:42:48,858
We're not insulting him
personally.

1826
01:42:48,860 --> 01:42:50,893
This is just the way
things are done down here.

1827
01:42:50,895 --> 01:42:52,829
Yeah, well,
he's not from down here.

1828
01:42:52,831 --> 01:42:54,964
Yeah, just-just ask him
to be reasonable.

1829
01:42:54,966 --> 01:42:56,599
I got 400 guests in there

1830
01:42:56,601 --> 01:42:57,834
expecting to be entertained
tonight.

1831
01:42:57,836 --> 01:43:00,069
And Dr. Shirley expects
to eat tonight.

1832
01:43:00,071 --> 01:43:02,774
Why can't you just make
an exception this one time?

1833
01:43:04,175 --> 01:43:06,776
Let me tell you a story.

1834
01:43:06,778 --> 01:43:10,113
You ever hear of the
Boston Celtics basketball club?

1835
01:43:10,115 --> 01:43:11,147
- Yeah.
- Well...

1836
01:43:11,149 --> 01:43:12,782
those boys came through here

1837
01:43:12,784 --> 01:43:14,917
couple years ago
on a barnstorming tour, and...

1838
01:43:14,919 --> 01:43:16,786
seeing as they was
the world champions

1839
01:43:16,788 --> 01:43:19,088
of the league and all, we were
tickled to have them here,

1840
01:43:19,090 --> 01:43:20,923
and we rolled out
the welcome wagon.

1841
01:43:20,925 --> 01:43:22,625
So, do you know what table

1842
01:43:22,627 --> 01:43:24,794
their big coon ate at
that night?

1843
01:43:24,796 --> 01:43:26,796
No.

1844
01:43:26,798 --> 01:43:29,932
I don't, either,
but it wasn't one of ours.

1845
01:43:29,934 --> 01:43:32,068
Now, let's cut the bullshit.

1846
01:43:32,070 --> 01:43:33,970
Tell me what it's
gonna take, huh?

1847
01:43:33,972 --> 01:43:36,674
Say, uh, a hundred dollars,
you get your boy to play?

1848
01:43:38,676 --> 01:43:40,676
You think you can buy me?

1849
01:43:40,678 --> 01:43:42,612
With all due respect, sir,

1850
01:43:42,614 --> 01:43:45,181
you wouldn't be in a job like
this if you couldn't be bought.

1851
01:43:45,183 --> 01:43:47,183
Stop.

1852
01:43:47,185 --> 01:43:48,753
Tony.

1853
01:43:50,055 --> 01:43:51,823
It's all right.

1854
01:43:53,858 --> 01:43:58,630
I'll play if you want me to.

1855
01:44:11,910 --> 01:44:13,109
All right.

1856
01:44:13,111 --> 01:44:14,846
Let's get the fuck out of here.

1857
01:44:16,114 --> 01:44:18,714
What do you mean,
"Let's get out of here"?

1858
01:44:18,716 --> 01:44:20,716
Where the hell
do you think you're going?

1859
01:44:20,718 --> 01:44:22,985
Don, don't do this. Now, you
signed a contract, and I...

1860
01:44:22,987 --> 01:44:25,221
I know you're the kind of man
who honors a contract.

1861
01:44:25,223 --> 01:44:27,256
Connie, Bill, everything's
gonna be fine. It's all right.

1862
01:44:27,258 --> 01:44:29,225
You got a show to do, mister.

1863
01:44:29,227 --> 01:44:30,993
You turn yourself around
right now, goddamn it!

1864
01:44:30,995 --> 01:44:33,096
Right now!

1865
01:44:33,098 --> 01:44:35,164
This is why you people
don't work down here.

1866
01:44:35,166 --> 01:44:37,133
'Cause you're unreliable,
you hear me?

1867
01:44:37,135 --> 01:44:40,605
I shipped that goddamn Steinway
in from Atlanta for you!

1868
01:44:47,812 --> 01:44:51,013
Tony, are you hungry?

1869
01:44:51,015 --> 01:44:53,751
Does Betty like butta... er?

1870
01:44:57,155 --> 01:45:00,690
<i>One, two...</i>

1871
01:45:37,829 --> 01:45:39,729
You a cop?

1872
01:45:39,731 --> 01:45:41,232
Do I look Irish?

1873
01:45:42,267 --> 01:45:43,833
What you want, baby?

1874
01:45:43,835 --> 01:45:45,234
Two Cutty Sarks, neat.

1875
01:45:45,236 --> 01:45:46,938
Coming up.

1876
01:45:53,811 --> 01:45:56,748
Mm. Whatever your
specialty is, we'll take it.

1877
01:45:57,815 --> 01:45:59,817
Two Orange Birds!

1878
01:46:11,829 --> 01:46:14,230
I like what you did
back there, Doc.

1879
01:46:14,232 --> 01:46:16,701
You stood up for yourself.

1880
01:46:18,303 --> 01:46:20,803
It's like what your friend,
the president, said.

1881
01:46:20,805 --> 01:46:23,272
"Ask not...

1882
01:46:23,274 --> 01:46:26,842
"your country
what you can do for it.

1883
01:46:26,844 --> 01:46:29,047
Ask what you do for yourself."

1884
01:46:30,114 --> 01:46:32,217
You know?

1885
01:46:33,785 --> 01:46:36,352
So, darling, what you do?

1886
01:46:36,354 --> 01:46:38,087
All dressed up like that.

1887
01:46:38,089 --> 01:46:40,056
Nothing particularly important.

1888
01:46:41,859 --> 01:46:43,292
Shouldn't judge a man
by his clothes.

1889
01:46:44,362 --> 01:46:47,296
He's only the greatest
piano player in the world.

1890
01:46:47,298 --> 01:46:48,864
That right?

1891
01:46:48,866 --> 01:46:50,866
You good?

1892
01:46:50,868 --> 01:46:53,202
Don't be shy, Doc.

1893
01:46:53,204 --> 01:46:54,904
Tell her who you are.

1894
01:46:54,906 --> 01:46:56,339
Don't tell me nothing.

1895
01:46:56,341 --> 01:46:58,276
Show me.

1896
01:47:04,082 --> 01:47:06,017
Come on.

1897
01:48:52,123 --> 01:48:55,360
Yeah! Yeah!

1898
01:50:24,348 --> 01:50:26,415
That's how you break a key.

1899
01:50:29,086 --> 01:50:30,486
Oh, that was a good time.

1900
01:50:30,488 --> 01:50:32,488
I'd do that once a month
for free.

1901
01:50:32,490 --> 01:50:34,123
You were unbelievable.

1902
01:50:34,125 --> 01:50:35,524
Hey, Tony.

1903
01:50:35,526 --> 01:50:38,360
I bet, if we leave right now,
we can make it.

1904
01:50:38,362 --> 01:50:39,629
Make what?

1905
01:50:39,631 --> 01:50:42,366
Christmas Eve,
in New York City.

1906
01:50:46,805 --> 01:50:48,471
Oh, shit!

1907
01:50:58,216 --> 01:51:01,986
Don't ever flash
your wad of cash in a bar.

1908
01:51:10,662 --> 01:51:13,262
I knew you had a gun.

1909

01:51:40,291 --> 01:51:41,557
Yes.

1918
01:51:41,559 --> 01:51:43,492
It's a shame we don't
have something

1919
01:51:43,494 --> 01:51:45,561
to protect us on our journey.

1920
01:51:45,563 --> 01:51:47,631
Oh, I know.

1921
01:51:47,633 --> 01:51:51,168
Why don't you put your lucky
rock up on the dash, Tony?

1922
01:51:53,170 --> 01:51:54,570
Come on, Tony.

1923
01:51:54,572 --> 01:51:57,308
We need all the help
we can get.

1924
01:52:01,647 --> 01:52:03,312
Thank you.

1925
01:52:03,314 --> 01:52:06,050
I feel safer already.

1926
01:52:07,451 --> 01:52:10,252
You're a real prick,
you know that?

1927
01:52:33,210 --> 01:52:35,614
Ah, shit!

1928
01:52:44,690 --> 01:52:46,692
Goddamn cops.

1929
01:52:56,635 --> 01:52:59,535
What are you doing out here?

1930
01:52:59,537 --> 01:53:01,339
We're trying to get
to New York.

1931
01:53:03,407 --> 01:53:05,441
